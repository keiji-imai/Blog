Masterpieces are often hard to appreciate.

[Giant Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwIC6B_dvW4) by John Coltrane is one example. If you don't understand the context of jazz and improvization, it's not clear why this particular song is considered a masterpiece. What about Giant Step's chord progression and solo is so much better than that of a less famous Coltrane song like [The Night has a Thousand Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPRCwpB1Ak)?

You need to spend an enormous amount of time studying music in order to truly appreciate these masterpieces. The same could be said for art (Mona Lisa, modern art, etc), literature (Shakespeare, Dickens, etc), and games (League, Starcraft 2, chess, etc). Most entertainment requires a big time investment in order to be fully appreciated.

Stories are different. Anybody can appreciate a well told story. Attack on Titan is peak storytelling.
