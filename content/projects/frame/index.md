## Introduction
As chassis lead for [MIT Motorsports](https://fsae.mit.edu/), I designed and built (with our welding team) a steel space frame for the MY24 car.

The design is thoroughly documented in the following files:

I compiled pictures and videos from the whole year of motorsports in the following recruiting montage:

## Literature

I found the following to be the most valuable literature for designing the frame:
 - Race Car Vehicle Dynamics by Milliken and Milliken (RCVD)
 - Bill Riley's [Design, Analasys, and Testing of a Formula SAE Car Chassis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267937654_2002-01-3300_Design_Analysis_and_Testing_of_a_Formula_SAE_Car_Chassis)
 - [The Effect of Chassis Stiffness on RaceCar Handling Balance](https://www.academia.edu/32672830/The_Effect_of_Chassis_Stiffness_on_Race_Car_Handling_Balance)
