Hi, I'm Keiji. I like building things. I'm a mechanical engineer on [MIT Motorsports](fsae.mit.edu) and build electric racecars. I write about my bigger projects under ["projects"](https://kogappa.com/projects/) and my smaller projects (and rants) under ["posts"](https://kogappa.com/posts/). Feel free to reach out to me at keijii@mit.edu.
