description: "3 reasons why I blog"
---

I had no plans of making a blog a few months ago. Here are the reasons that changed my mind.

## For Inspiration

Inspiration has two ingredients. First, you have to see something awesome. Then you have to convince yourself that you can do something just as awesome. 

I've experienced this first-hand. At RoboCup 2019, I was blown away by the [insane robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gupdy-QfdE) we competed against. But after talking to the people who built them, I realized I could make world-class robots too. The same thing happened when I went to my first FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). I began to realize how much I could do if I set my mind to it.

You don't have to talk to your role models to be inspired by them. There are fantastic resources on the internet. Here are a few online sources that inspired me.

 - [Paul Graham's essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) inspired me to pursue startups
 - [Team Transcendence's Website](https://bozo.infocommsociety.com/) inspired me to build better soccer robots
 - [FRC Reveal Videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=frc+reveal+video) made me fall in love with FRC
 - [Build-its](https://build-its-feed.blogspot.com/) and other [MITERS](http://miters.mit.edu/) blogs inspired me to make a blog

Paul Graham's essays inspire me more than Elon Musk's startups, because his essays actually make me believe that I can build something awesome. 

Having been inspired by so many people before me, it's my responsibility to help inspire the next generation of engineers. If I do something cool and write about it here, maybe someday someone will read this and be inspired to do something cool themselves.

## Recognition
I have selfish reasons for creating a blog too. I can use my website to showcase my projects for research and career opportunities. It's also a good way to show what I'm working on with friends. 

## Science and Technology

When I was building soccer robots, I spent days poring over blogs of past teams. For FRC, I spent a stupid amount of time reading  chiefdelphi (online forum) and studying CAD models of robots from previous years. The information people published online was super useful for my own projects. I'm really grateful for this documentation.

I've always built stuff for fun. But if I don't write about my projects, I'm only helping myself. To contribute to science, and help others, I need to share what I learned. Documenting my work allows people working on similar projects to learn from what I did, making their projects even better.

## Conclusion

In short, other people's documentation helped me a lot so I'm trying to pay it back a little. If you feel the same way, consider making a blog yourself!
