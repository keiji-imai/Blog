Since coming to MIT, I've learned a lot of things I wish I knew in high school. I'll try to summarize the most important things. But first, I strongly recommend you read [Paul Graham's essay](http://paulgraham.com/hs.html) about the same topic. It's really good. 

## Motivation is the bottleneck

When I was in high school, my excuse for not doing important things was "I don't have time" or "I'm not smart enough" or "I don't have the resources". I told myself that it wasn't my fault.

I was wrong. I did have the time. I was smart enough. And I did have the resources. What I lacked was motivation. If I had *really* wanted to learn how to solve differential equations or build a CNC machine, I totally could have. At MIT I've met people who built [walking quadrupeds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sht5Nenk3Dg), [nuclear fusors](https://www.anhadsawhney.com/#/nuclear-fusor/), and functional jet engines in high school. These people aren't geniuses. They just love what they do and work really hard at it. It is insane how much you can do if you set your mind to it. So don't blame things outside of your control until you have done absolutely everything you can.

But how does one find motivation to work hard? There are two approaches:
1. Brute force:
Have the discipline to work on difficult and tedious things. Make a strategy to achieve your goals and do what needs to be done. I'm terrible at this. I procrastinate and get distracted whenever I have to do boring work, even if it is really important (homework, getting a driver's license, etc). 
2. Passion:
Choose to work on fun projects. Instead of spending time on work you don't enjoy, find projects that are both challenging and exciting. If you are able to find a really cool project, the motivation will come naturally. You'll want to spend as much time working on your project as possible. 

What if you don't know what you are passionate about? 

Speaking for myself, coolness, competitiveness, and comaraderie were the driving factors behind my motivation to do robotics. The simplest explanation for how I got into robotics is that I thought robots were really cool. I joined my middle school's FIRST Lego League team for fun, and got utterly demolished at every competition. That made me mad. I hate losing. Wanting to win robotics competitions was a big motivator throughout high school. Finally, I love building robots because I do it with friends. There's a certain kind of comaraderie that you get by working together trying to do something really really hard.

For me, robotics was like a sport. I looked up to [the Cheesy Poofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-IrVbsl_K8) the same way people looked up to Michael Jordan. Coolness, competition, and comaraderie motivated me to work hard.

If you don't know what you are passionate about, try joining clubs or teams that do cool things. 

## Your time is precious

High school classes suck. Sitting in a classroom bored all day might make you feel like your time isn't worth a whole lot. But the truth is, your time is super valuable. There are so many incredible things you can do with your time.

The internet is full of world-class educational resources if you just know where to look. Hopefully this onslaught of completely free resources will drive home my point.

### MIT OpenCourseWare

[These free online courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/) are really good. So good, in fact, that I often skip in-person lectures so that I can watch OCW videos. They record lectures of the most popular professors so they are much better than the average in-person lecture at MIT. 
Here are some introductory classes I've taken that have really good OCW counterparts:
 - [3.091 (Solid State Chemistry)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/3-091-introduction-to-solid-state-chemistry-fall-2018/)
 - [18.01 (Single-variable Calculus)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/video_galleries/video-lectures/)
 - [18.02 (Multi-variable Calculus)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/)
 - [18.03 (Differential Equations)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-03-differential-equations-spring-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/)
 - [8.01 (Classical Mechanics)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-01l-physics-i-classical-mechanics-fall-2005/)
 - [8.02 (Electricity and Magnetism)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2007/)
 - [2.001 (Mechanics & Materials I)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-001-mechanics-materials-i-fall-2006/pages/lecture-notes/)

### Stanford Machine Learning class 

[videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv), [course notes](https://cs231n.github.io/), [coding assignments](https://github.com/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/tree/master/assignments/2022). I haven't taken this course, but someone I know said it was really good. 

### Harvard philosophy class
You may not care for philosophy, but Michael Sandel is a rockstar. His philosophy lectures fill concert stadiums worldwide. Watch the [first lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdfcR-8hEY&list=PL30C13C91CFFEFEA6) and you'll see why. Or read his [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452731-justice?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=kPokpiprkP&rank=7).

### History Books
The best way to learn history is not studying a Princeton Review AP US History prep book. You should read good history books. There are so many, but I've only read a couple. [Guns, Germs, and Steel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1842.Guns_Germs_and_Steel?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_10) is an incredible nonfiction book taking a scientific approach to history and [The Grapes of Wrath](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=c1DRKDZeBZ&rank=1) was so powerful that it made me cry.

### Programming Courses
There are more high quality resources for learning programming than there are for any other subject. Personally I can recommend [this python course](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/) and [this C++ course](https://www.learncpp.com/). 

### Programming Challenges
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) has really fun and challenging programming challenges that I highly recommend. For learning controls (how to program robots), check out these awesome [programming challenges](https://janismac.github.io/ControlChallenges/).

### Math Textbooks
A lot of people think they are "bad at math". The truth is that their teachers were bad at math. The internet comes to the rescue once again. [The Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) sells books that make MIT math classes look bad. They also have a really cool free online learning system called [Alcumulus](https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus). AoPS teaches you how to learn math by solving challenging problems, not just memorizing formulas and step-by-step solutions. Having completed almost all of the AoPS textbooks, I cannot recommend them enough. They are hard, but they will fundamentally change the way you think about math.

### Mechanical Engineering
If your high school has a robotics team and you like robots, you should join. You can also start your own team. Building robots is way easier and fun when you do it with friends, and the competitive element is a strong motivator. 

For learning how to design robots with Computer-Aided Design (CAD), I strongly recommend [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/education/). It's really easy to learn due to its super intuitive user interface and excellent [online tutorials](https://learn.onshape.com/learning-paths/onshape-fundamentals-cad). Onshape is completely free for students, but if you school or robotics team gives you access to SolidWorks, that's good too. Avoid Fusion360, it's terrible CAD software (good for CAM though).

Another recommendation is buying a 3D printer. It is unbelievable how much you can do with just a 3D printer. If you have the money, I recommend [Prusa machines](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/3d-printers/), because the ease of use and print quality is unmatched. Cheap 3D printers are tempting, but be warned that they require a ton of maintenance and upgrades (I learned this the hard way). If you want a challenge, try building a high performance 3D printer. I recommend [RatRig](https://ratrig.com/3d-printers.html) and [Voron](https://vorondesign.com/). There are entire [discord communities](https://discord.gg/ratrig) and youtube channels on your side. 

You can also buy a CNC router, which allows you to make metal parts for high performance robots. I recommend the [Omio](https://www.omiocnc.com/products.html) line of CNC machines. Machining is super cool and a great skill to have.

### Personal Projects
Finally, if you want to be good at anything, you need to work on projects of your own. I have a friend who taught herself how to code and is now making 6 figures at an AI startup straight out of high school. She's not a genius, she just really loves programming. Ben Katz, the creator of the [MIT Minicheetah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNeZWP5Mx9s), became an incredible engineer by building things for fun (read about his projects on his [blog](https://build-its.blogspot.com/)). You'd be surprised by how much you can do by yourself.

## College Applications

I feel obligated to include this because a lot of high school students think a lot about college applications.

How do you get into your dream school?

Do what you love and don't waste time. MIT Admissions officer Chris Peterson wrote an [excellent essay](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/) making the same point.

Do what you love because it's exciting. If you think robots are cool, build robots. If you think programming is cool, write some cool code. This is worth doing whether it helps you get into your dream school or not. 

That being said, you want to make sure admissions officers realize that you have skills. But there are ways to do what you love while simultaneously boosting your application. For example, competing in FIRST Robotics competitions or AMC math competitions can be a lot of fun if you love robotics/math and want to win, and as a side benefit what you do in these competitons shows admissions officers that you aren't just bluffing about your skills.

Don't waste time. [Life is short](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html). So don't spend your time doing things that aren't important to you.

## Conclusion

As a high schooler I didn't realize how much I could do if only I tried hard enough. I hope that this post helps you appreciate how valuable your time really is.

Finally, if you haven't read Paul Graham's article I recommended in the beginning, here's [the link](http://paulgraham.com/hs.html) again. I'll end with a quote from his essay:

>Maybe you can be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't how much time you wasted.
