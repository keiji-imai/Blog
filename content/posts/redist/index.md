description: "Building a redistricting puzzle game"
---

I built a redistricting puzzle game as a Christmas present for my dad. I lasercut all the parts out of acrylic with help from my friend Gloria and Claudius helped me glue the pieces together.

## Context
My dad made a statistical method for drawing fair congressional district maps and testified as an expert witness in several gerrymandering court cases. He demonstrated that the existing maps were extremely gerrymandered by comparing them to thousands of algorithmically generated maps. The Ohio case went to the Supreme Court, so I decided to make a puzzle in the shape of Ohio.

## The Game





## The Puzzle

The puzzle is shaped in the state of Ohio. Each piece is a county. There are 88 counties, with many similar features, so the puzzle is surprisingly difficult. There are four sets of pieces in different colors. The base is inscribed with the borderlines not to make the puzzle easy, but to make it possible. 

To lasercut the pieces, we used this svg of the Ohio counties.

We made the base by lasercutting two acrylic plates and gluing them together. To my surprise, the super glue dried in half a second. This resulted in the two plates being slightly misaligned. Worse, the superglue left a smear in between the plates. If I were making another base, I'd use opaque acrylic for the top plate and be much more careful with alignment.

## The Box

I decided to make the box on a whim. At first I used plywood from a scrap pile. It was really bad. The first cut didn't go all the way through, so I had to redo the cut, which left a really bad surface finish on the edges. The pieces didn't even fit.

I made a new box using acrylic. It's bigger and the four corners are colored to match the pieces. I'm really happy with how pretty it came out.
