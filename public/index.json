I worked on a Starshield team, which does government and defense satellites, so I can\u0026rsquo;t talk about any specifics of my internship. So instead I\u0026rsquo;d like to focus on why SpaceX is such an incredible company and what I learned from this internship.\nWhat I learned # As a sort of final project of my internship, I designed a custom PCB fastener for a Starshield satellite. I determined the design criteria including board strain, TIM strain, gasket compression, tolerances, structural loading, and RF packaging requirements. I analyzed my fastener arrangement in FEMAP, determined the boundary conditions and sized for shipping and ascent, orbit, and connector installation. I analyzed many fastener arrangements and radiator stiffnesses to justify my design. Additionally, I analyzed the axial and lateral tolerance stackups, accounting for the worst case CTE mismatches across hot and cold cases, swept across time and beta angle. I presented a design criteria review and preliminary design review, then handed off my work to the Starshield team. While working at SpaceX I learned how to analyze bolted joints, fatigue analysis using NASGRO, tolerance stackups with thermal loading, and dynamic loading, which generally helped me understand what truly rigorous mechanical engineering looks like.\nMore generally, I had two major takeways:\nask experienced people for advice on direction (what to work on, what approach to take, etc) rather than technical support if you can answer the key questions with physical testing, you should. Why SpaceX is even cooler than I imagined # Rockets # This stuff is just so inspiring and unbelievable.\nIt sounds insane, but I actually believe SpaceX will build a self-sustaining civilization on Mars within our lifetimes, given the rate of progress that they\u0026rsquo;ve been making.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t even get me started on Raptor.\nJust look at the visual difference between the Raptor 3 and the next best rocket engine out there. Stoke space is the only other company with a full flow staged combustion engine, which is the holy grail of rocket engine architectures.\nStarlink # I think people generally don\u0026rsquo;t realize how revolutionary of a technology Starlink is. I think it\u0026rsquo;s more likely than not that in our lifetimes, almost all internet will be broadcasted from space. There\u0026rsquo;s a reason that the majority of SpaceX\u0026rsquo;s launches have been exclusively launching starlink satellites. The biggest payoff in the short term for Falcon 9 and reusable rocket technology is making enormous satellite networks like Starlink possible.\nThere are currently almost 7,000 starlink satellites in orbit. You can see them here: https://satellitemap.space/?constellation=starlink#\nThese are the summary of global orbital space launches in Q1 of 2024, as reported by Bryce Tech. In 14 weeks, SpaceX had 31 launches and put 525 spacecraft into orbit. This is more than an order of magnitude higher than China and Russia\u0026rsquo;s space programs put together! It\u0026rsquo;s hard to grasp how dominant SpaceX is.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s more than two rocket launches and 40 satellites per week! How can you manufacture 40 satellites (each costing millions of dollars) and 2 rockets ($70 million per launch) every week, where the slightest quality control defect can result in complete mission failure?\nSpaceX had their first mission failure since June 2015 in July 11, 2024. The engineering rigor needed to see these levels of reliability and performance is simply absurd.\nV2 Mini # The satellites have been designed to stack tightly to pack a ton of satellites in a rocket, while deploying their two massive dual axis solar arrays and electronics on orbit. The satellites are extremely lightweight and compact as a result.\nDirect-to-Cell # Phased Arrays # SpaceX provides internet to users through phased arrays. These are PCBs with evenly spaced antennae elements that are fired in a precise sequence to generate a RF beam that can be steered with mind-breaking precision. This allows a satellite the size of a car orbiting at 18,000 mph trying to communicate with a laptop-sized PCB mounted to someone\u0026rsquo;s roof or a boat in the middle of the Pacific. Here are some cool visuals of phased arrays from wikipedia:\nDeploy Footage # Video of last night’s @Starlink satellite deployment pic.twitter.com/K7ezZLLusz\n\u0026mdash; SpaceX (@SpaceX) September 16, 2023 First Starlink v2 satellites reach orbit pic.twitter.com/0l08568mJ9\n\u0026mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 28, 2023 ","date":"29 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/spacex/","section":"Projects","summary":"What I learned interning at SpaceX","title":"Starshield","type":"projects"},{"content":"To be a good Formula One driver, you first need to beat your teammate. Nobody else has the same car — they are the one driver you have no excuse for losing to. Unfortunately for Nico Rosberg, his teammate was Lewis Hamilton, his childhood friend and reigning two-time world champion.\nBut Rosberg was tired of coming in second. In the 2016 Spanish GP, Rosberg had the lead, and as Hamilton tried to dart around Rosberg cut him off, forcing Hamilton into the grass where he spun out and sent both cars crashing into the dirt1. They collided again in the 2016 Austrian GP as they fought for first place.\nIn an interview later that season, Rosberg said,\n\u0026ldquo;I decided to stop cycling because the leg muscles are among the heaviest things on your body. I lost 1kg as a result that August. One kilo of body weight is 0.04 of a second per lap when the car is at the weight limit. I was on pole at Suzuka by 0.03 seconds. My smaller leg muscles got me on pole.\u0026rdquo;\nRosberg then won at Suzuka, giving him the points necessary to take the world champion title from Hamilton. He retired 5 days after winning the championship.\nNico Rosberg won for the same reason that he crashed. He won by dancing on the edge. Sometimes he fell off the edge and crashed, losing races and risking injury. But if he had stayed clear of the edge he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had any chance at all.\nDesigning a racecar is as precarious as driving one. Lightweight cars are faster, but if even one component is too light, it fails and your car breaks. By doing rigorous calculations, simulation and testing, racecar engineers design parts that are as efficient as possible and just barely strong enough. The fastest car is the closest to its breaking point.\nRacing pushes people to their limits too. I found my limit through Formula SAE, a collegiate engineering competition where students around the world build formula-one style racecars. As system leads on MIT Motorsports, my friends and I sacrificed our grades, health, and social life, and endured immense stress and frustration for the car. Sometimes we pushed ourselves too far and burned out, but for some reason we got up and kept going every time.\nUnpaid suffering is synonymous with the Formula SAE experience. In his book \u0026ldquo;Racecar: Searching for the Limit in Formula SAE,\u0026rdquo; Matt Brown writes,\n\u0026ldquo;During one of my seldom trips home, a high school friend asked me why I had chosen, among all of life’s opportunities, to spend all my time on a racecar. I didn’t have an answer for him. I had never thought about it. Amidst all the chaos and stress and frustration, during all the sleepless nights and last minute deadlines, I never asked myself why I was doing it.\u0026rdquo;\nThe natural takeaway is that Formula SAE teams are full of masochistic workaholics with questionable life priorities. There may be some truth to that, but it\u0026rsquo;s worth exploring why these students care so much about their glorified go-karts.\nThe \u0026ldquo;live to work\u0026rdquo; stereotype describes people who work more than 80 hours a week and are driven by toxic work culture, egotistic addiction to ambition, or taking pride in working longer hours than others. Not exactly the picture of personal happiness and fulfillment. What\u0026rsquo;s more, in many environments, working longer hours actually results in less work getting done. Studies consistently show that working more than 50 hours a week for an extended period of time cripples productivity to the point that progress actually drops below what it would have been with a 40 hour workweek.\nBut for most people, working is a means to an end. In other words, they \u0026ldquo;work to live.\u0026rdquo; In the short piece \u0026ldquo;The Work You Do, the Person You Are,\u0026rdquo; Toni Morrison describes how working a cleaning job as a child shaped her perspective on work. She was proud of making money to help her parents pay the bills, but the work itself was tedious and painful. When she shared her problems with her father, he told her,\n\u0026ldquo;Listen. You don’t live there. You live here. With your people. Go to work. Get your money. And come on home.\u0026rdquo;\nMorrison interpreted this as follows:\n1. Whatever the work is, do it well—not for the boss but for yourself. 2. You make the job; it doesn’t make you. 3. Your real life is with us, your family. 4. You are not the work you do; you are the person you are.\nThis attitude is different from \u0026ldquo;living to work\u0026rdquo; in two ways: your self-worth is not determined by your work, and that your personal life is more important than your work. Take your work seriously, but remember that you\u0026rsquo;re doing it so that you can go home and do the things that truly make you happy — spending time with family, having fun with friends, and enjoying leisure activities.\nThe problem with work-life balance is the assumption that work and life can\u0026rsquo;t mix. For the sake of argument, let\u0026rsquo;s define work as the things you have to do, including studying for school and doing taxes, in addition to working for money. In the context of work-life balance, life is what you choose to do, like spending time with friends and family. Work-life balance assumes that what you have to do and what you want to do are mutually exclusive. But they don\u0026rsquo;t have to be.\nSomething special happens when you do focused work for a long time2. You get addicted. You don\u0026rsquo;t notice it, but you\u0026rsquo;re much more efficient than usual. You\u0026rsquo;re so immersed that work that would normally be tedious is somehow enjoyable. Before you know it, sunlight is pouring through the windows, and you realize you\u0026rsquo;ve spent all night working, not because you had to, but because you wanted to.\nIf your work is exciting and meaningful, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like work. Work like this makes you feel alive. It defies the diminishing productivity problem — If you love your work, you can work long hours without losing productivity because you\u0026rsquo;re having fun. You\u0026rsquo;d have trouble finding a professional athlete who doesn\u0026rsquo;t love their job, because pain and effort required to get there is too much for someone who isn\u0026rsquo;t deeply in love with the sport. The way to escape work-life balance is doing work that you love.\nUnfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s not that easy to be passionate about work. It has to come naturally. Even if you love your job in theory, usually life gets in the way and working is a drag in practice.\nLast summer, I was a mechanical design intern at an amazing robotics company called Mujin. The engineering I got to do was awesome. I was designing complex mechanisms, getting them manufactured, and assembling and testing them myself. On paper, this was my dream job. But after a month of working all day every day I started getting tired of it. Sometimes I wanted to work and sometimes I didn\u0026rsquo;t, but I had to show up on time every day anyway. As an intern, I have friends on the team and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be at the company for long enough to see my projects make it to production.\nOn MIT Motorsports I have full ownership over my projects. As Chassis Lead, the car\u0026rsquo;s frame is my responsibility. I set my own deadlines and I can work on my own terms as long as the frame is built on time for the team to have a functional car.\nMy teammates on MIT Motorsports are also my closest friends at MIT. Working together is fun. We joke around and support each other in a way that isn\u0026rsquo;t possible in a typical work environment. We go on ski trips and celebrate holidays together. And most importantly, the late nights in shop and the hard work that everyone put in built up strong camaraderie and mutual respect.\nThe third reason I work hard is because I want to win. At last year\u0026rsquo;s competition, we saw the best teams with our own eyes — ETS\u0026rsquo;s beautiful wheel packages3, Georgia Tech\u0026rsquo;s 3.6 second acceleration run4, and UW\u0026rsquo;s beautiful monocoque5 — and I decided that next year we\u0026rsquo;re going to roll in to the pits with a car like that. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough to try our best and learn a lot. We had to be the best.\nDesigning, building, and testing an electric racecar in a single year is an insane amount of work to do voluntarily. But we aren\u0026rsquo;t getting paid to show up, and nobody is doing it for the career boost6. We did it because cared about the mission and the team. Regardless of what your values are, the key to loving your work is aligning your career with what you care about most.\nBut caring so much about your work risks burning out. Let me explain with a vehicle dynamics analogy. Below is a graph of lateral force vs slip angle. The vertical axis represents how fast the car can turn a corner, and the horizontal axis is how aggressively the driver is steering. The multiple curves show how the tire\u0026rsquo;s performance decreases as the weight on it increases.\nSource: Racecar Vehicle Dynamics, Milliken and Milliken\nThe harder the driver steers, the faster they can corner. But there is a point (the peak of the curves above) where the tires lose grip and start slipping, causing the car to spin out and crash. This maximum steering angle depends on many factors that change throughout a race, including weight transfer, speed, and tire temperature. A car has less traction available for steering when it is braking, so you can easily crash by braking too late when approaching a corner. Racecar drivers have to understand the effects of these factors and feel the change in steering wheel force as they turn in order to stay just barely below the limit of the tire\u0026rsquo;s traction7.\nSimilarly, you need to know where your limit is at all times to work as hard as you can. Like a racecar\u0026rsquo;s maximum steering angle, a person\u0026rsquo;s limit depends on many external factors, such as stress, personal circumstances, and health. You need to understand these factors to avoid pushing yourself over the limit.\nBurning out helped me understand where my limit is. In January this year, I had no classes and I worked 100 hours a week for four weeks straight building the frame8. Every day I would wake up, shower, and work all day, eating meals in shop and leaving to go home after midnight. If I did not do this, the car would not have been built quickly enough to be tested and tuned before competition. I remember how I would bike to shop to work on the car wishing that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to. I cared so much about finishing the frame that I didn\u0026rsquo;t make sure that I was enjoying myself. But hours per week is not the only indicator of where your limit is. While an F1 driver\u0026rsquo;s limit is determined by physics, my limit is affected by deadlines, exams, sleep schedule, and mental health. In the fall semester I was constantly weaving through deadlines, exams, and 9 am lectures, and several times I spiraled out of control and crashed.\nYou know you\u0026rsquo;re about to crash when work isn\u0026rsquo;t fun anymore. Taking good classes and building a racecar should be exciting. Sometimes, I pulled all-nighters pushing for a deadline and went to sleep the next day questioning if it was worth it. There were other times where I skipped lectures, rushed my problem sets, and crammed for exams at the cost of my understanding of the material. I felt awful. My grades and mental health suffered. These should have been glaring red flags that I\u0026rsquo;ve reached my limit and that I need to step on the brakes. You can\u0026rsquo;t win a race if your car is in pieces on the side of the track.\nYet, somehow, when the frame and all the stress, pain, and depression that came with it was done, I didn\u0026rsquo;t regret much. If I could go back to last summer, I\u0026rsquo;d do some things differently to avoid burning out, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t give up. I\u0026rsquo;d do almost all of it again.\nLife is too short to drive like an Uber driver. Pushing yourself and loving what you do is what makes life exciting. George Barnard Shaw said it best:\nThis is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one\u0026hellip;\nI want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work the more I live. I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no \u0026ldquo;brief candle\u0026rdquo; for me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.\nTo fully appreciate life is to full send it — push yourself to the limit because you love what you do, rather than working just to pay the bills. You might crash, but life is not a single race — it\u0026rsquo;s a thousand races. As long as you don\u0026rsquo;t die, you can learn from your mistakes and keep racing. You grow by getting back up again. Like an F1 driver who has learned exactly how hard he can steer from countless crashes and near misses, pushing yourself teaches you what approaching your limit feels like so that you can slow down before you burn out. Learn to drive fast without crashing. It\u0026rsquo;s better to live this way, dancing on the edge, than to coast your way through every corner of life.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the footage and Nico Rosberg\u0026rsquo;s explanation of what happened\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n. Scientists call this flow. Tim Urban explains it on his blog \u0026ldquo;WaitButWhy\u0026rdquo; .\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nTopology-optimized 3D printed titanium uprights with the motor and cooling channels packaged inside.

The acceleration event is a 75 meter sprint, and their car did it in 3.6 seconds. The next fastest was ETS with a 3.8 seconds (not even close by racing standards). \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nA monocoque is where the frame is a single piece made of aluminum honeycomb sandwiched between sheets of carbon fiber. University of Washington\u0026rsquo;s monocoque weighed 50 lbs, while my steel space frame this year weighs 81. UW\u0026rsquo;s car was gorgeous: \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nAlthough having FSAE on your resume is a huge boost (I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have gotten my SpaceX internship without it and the best engineering companies recruit heavily from these competitions), 80% of the time put into Motorsports does not directly advance your career — manufacturing hundreds of parts, teaching other members, planning and management, and other high time commitment low prestige work. You can tell when someone is doing racecar only for their career when they don\u0026rsquo;t want to do unrewarding work. Thankfully, these people tend to quit the team before long.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nWatch this video to see how perfectly F1 drivers turn a corner - if Pérez were to brake or steer just a hair more he would have crashed.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSome pictures of the frame: \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"12 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/rants/racecar/","section":"Rants","summary":"The only way to find your limit","title":"Dancing on the Edge","type":"rants"},{"content":"I wrote the following essay for a class, 21W.735 Reading and Writing the Essay (one of my all time favorite classes). It got published in MIT\u0026rsquo;s newspaper, the Tech! (but please read it here because I\u0026rsquo;ve made some minor edits)\nA strange loneliness crept over me when I noticed the man with a \u0026ldquo;Free Listening\u0026rdquo; sign sitting on the steps of Lobby 7. It occurred to me that I had approached him the day before because nobody else sincerely wanted to talk to me. As I stood there, waiting for my next Campus Preview Weekend (CPW) event, I wondered if I would be able to form lasting friendships in college. Eventually I built up the courage to talk to him again.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, how\u0026rsquo;s it going?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful day,\u0026rdquo; he said, putting down his book.\n\u0026ldquo;I know, it really cleared up,\u0026rdquo; I said. \u0026ldquo;Um, if you don\u0026rsquo;t mind me asking, how long have you been doing this?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Since 2018 or so, but only when the weather is decent.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Dang, that\u0026rsquo;s a long time,\u0026rdquo; I said. \u0026ldquo;Why do you do it?\u0026rdquo;\nHe thought for a moment.\n\u0026ldquo;I think that bad things can happen when someone has nobody who listens to them,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;There was a point in my life when I really needed someone to talk to, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want what happened to me to happen to anyone else. That\u0026rsquo;s why I want to listen to people.\u0026rdquo;\nI was taken aback by his kindness. He was giving up so much of his time to help others. His worldview seemed fundamentally different from the MIT students I\u0026rsquo;d talked to all weekend. They would work unbelievably hard to become researchers and engineers, yet it felt like the only time they would go out of their way for others was when it would benefit themselves in some way.\nIt occurred to me that I was just as self-serving. I wondered if I only did nice things for my friends and family so that they would see me as a good person. How many nice things would I have done if nobody would ever know that it was me who did them? Would I have done them for a stranger? To be honest, if I knew that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t affect my life at all, I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do too much to help others.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t think of the last time I did something truly selfless,\u0026rdquo; I said, suddenly tearing up. \u0026ldquo;I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m only pretending to be a good person.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;ve done plenty of good things,\u0026rdquo; he said gently. \u0026ldquo;What does it take for a good thing to be selfless?\u0026rdquo;\nI hadn\u0026rsquo;t thought about that before.\n\u0026ldquo;You have to be doing it to help others, not yourself,\u0026rdquo; I decided. \u0026ldquo;Like cleaning a park when nobody\u0026rsquo;s watching. It\u0026rsquo;s not selfless if you\u0026rsquo;re only doing it so that other people will see you doing it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;So you have to do good things for the right reasons.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You strike me as a good person though,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;You want to be selfless, and that has to mean something.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m just pretending to be a good person,\u0026rdquo; I said again. \u0026ldquo;I tell myself that I want to make the world a better place, but when I think about it, everything I do is just to benefit myself. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s the only way to get into a school like this. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s just how everybody is. But I feel like a fraud. I want to be a good person, like you, not just someone who pretends.\u0026rdquo;\nHe thought about that for a second, then said, \u0026ldquo;You know, I think people are like trees. When you\u0026rsquo;re young, you need to focus on growing. Eventually, you\u0026rsquo;ll become a big tree and you can give back. It\u0026rsquo;s okay to focus on yourself right now.\u0026rdquo;\nTwo years later, I sometimes remember my conversation with the “free listening” man, who goes by Kip, and think about what it means to me to be a good person. The conversation made me realize that I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have to feel bad about doing things to benefit myself. Prioritizing my classes and projects allows me to become an engineer who can change the world for the better, and choosing an impactful career makes my studying about something bigger than myself.\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t upset about not doing enough for the world though — I felt bad about doing good things for selfish reasons. Couldn’t Kip also be doing it all for himself? What if he listened to strangers because it made him feel better about himself? Maybe everything that we do is self-serving at some level. But even if nothing is entirely selfless, at least listening feels genuine even if you derive personal fulfillment from it. Pursuing an impactful career because you want to feel good about the difference that you made in the world is still admirable. It’s possible to be self-serving and good, as long as I\u0026rsquo;m driven by my own principles more than external rewards.\nAt the time, I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand why Kip cared so much about listening to people. I knew that listening was important, but I had always felt that most people, including myself, have people who care about them and are happy to listen to them. I thought that the hard part was making people comfortable with opening up, not listening.\nBut when I found myself fighting depression, I began to appreciate the importance of listening. I would open up to people, and yet, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t feel understood. Sometimes, people wouldn’t care; other times, they would care but they wouldn’t understand.\nBeing a good listener is like being a good person — you can’t fake it. Opening up to someone who really cares about your feelings and tries to understand them feels different from talking to someone who listens out of obligation. The more people cared about me, the more they tried to understand my feelings, which mattered much more than whether they could make eye contact or not.\nBut listening skills are also needed to make someone feel understood. When I started therapy, I immediately noticed how my therapist would ask questions that showed that they were trying to understand my feelings even if they didn’t get it right away. Feeling depressed made me care more about other people\u0026rsquo;s feelings, so I started making more of an effort to put myself in other people\u0026rsquo;s shoes. I realized that I sometimes said things in a way that was easily misinterpreted or responded with suggestions when I should have focused on understanding. With practice, I began to learn how to be a better listener.\nMy understanding of what being a good person means has also changed throughout my life. I used to think that being a good person was about what you do to make the world a better place, but I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that it\u0026rsquo;s not just what you do; it\u0026rsquo;s also why you do it. I could donate all my savings to charity, but instead of making me feel like a better person, I would feel like someone pretending to be a good person. Even if I managed to hide it from everyone, I’d feel like I was trying to convince myself I was a better person than I was. What\u0026rsquo;s the point of doing good if, deep down, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean it?\nKip, on the other hand, cares about people so much that he wants to spend his afternoons listening to strangers. When you have a conversation with him, you can tell that he is enjoying it. He cares about you as a person, and he isn’t just doing it to make himself feel better. Being a good person has to come naturally: by living life and building empathy.\nDepression made me a better person by making me realize the value of listening. At the end of my sophomore year, I finally understood what Kip had told me during CPW. Real listening is not an abundant resource as I had once believed. It\u0026rsquo;s a gift that can only be given by someone who sincerely cares about you. Listening is free yet also precious.\n","date":"12 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/rants/listening/","section":"Rants","summary":"What it means to be a good person","title":"Free Listening","type":"rants"},{"content":"Nontechnical posts about things I like talking about.\n","date":"12 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/rants/","section":"Rants","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNontechnical posts about things I like talking about.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Rants","type":"rants"},{"content":" Intro # Shape of Voice is my favorite movie because it\u0026rsquo;s the best story about overcoming depression that I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced. Let me explain why (without spoilers).\nSidenote: Due to mistranslation, the movie is also known as \u0026ldquo;A Silent Voice\u0026rdquo;. The Japanese name \u0026ldquo;Koe no Katachi\u0026rdquo; directly translates to \u0026ldquo;Shape of Voice\u0026rdquo;, but I imagine they changed it to \u0026ldquo;A Silent Voice\u0026rdquo; because that\u0026rsquo;s smoother, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t change it everywhere so the movie has two names now. It\u0026rsquo;s kinda silly how high-budget anime productions have mistranslated titles. For example, Attack on Titan\u0026rsquo;s Japanese name is Shingeki no Kyojin, which translates directly to \u0026ldquo;The Attack Titan\u0026rdquo;. The name \u0026ldquo;Attack on Titan\u0026rdquo; makes no sense.\nPlot # The story follows Shoya Ishida, who bullied a deaf girl named Nishimiya in middle school. In high school, Ishida struggles with depression and tries to make amends with Nishimiya. The movie is about Ishida learning to make friends, love himself, and enjoy life again.\nBeauty # As usual, I\u0026rsquo;ll start with the music so that you can listen while reading.\nI really liked the gentle soundtrack. Here are my favorites:\nAnd the art is super aesthetic:\nThe beautiful illustrations and music help convey the main message of the movie \u0026ndash; what makes life worth living.\nDepression # Pain # Depression hurts. It\u0026rsquo;s not just being unhappy, it\u0026rsquo;s a deep, physical pain coming from the bottom of your stomach. Shape of Voice depicts this realy well, and this helps you empathize with people struggling with depression.\nLoneliness # Shape of Voice uses X\u0026rsquo;s to illustrate loneliness. It\u0026rsquo;s a brilliant way to show what it\u0026rsquo;s like to be convinced that everybody dislikes you. It\u0026rsquo;s painful to talk to people because your head is full of all the negative things that they\u0026rsquo;re thinking about you.\nSelf-hate # Shape of Voice shows how self-hate can lead to hurting people you care about.\nThis is an important theme because realizing that your depression is hurting others is the first step to understanding that the self-hatred itself is the problem (and not yourself).\nCommunication # Many problems related to depression are caused by a lack of communication. Often people don\u0026rsquo;t know what a depressed person is going through because the person bottles everything up or others are unable to understand them. At the same time, the depressed person usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how much people care about them because that can also be difficult to communicate.\nIf people were able to effectively communicate how much pain they feel to their loved ones, there would be fewer people at funerals wondering what they could have done differently.\nShape of Voice demonstrates these ideas incredibly well through both Ishida\u0026rsquo;s personal struggles and Nishimiya\u0026rsquo;s deafness preventing them from communicating effectively.\nFriendship # \u0026ldquo;I think friendship is beyond logic and words. Requirements can kiss my ass.\u0026rdquo;\nShape of Voice also shows what friendship means.\nThe movie shows how the idea that people would be happier without you is completely wrong. People care about you more than you realize.\nHealing # Shape of Voice is a sad movie, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a sad ending. It shows you how to overcome depression and find happiness.\nThis optimistic, uplifting message is why I love Shape of Voice so much. It helps you empathize with people struggling with depression and it helps you overcome depression yourself.\n","date":"28 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/rants/voice/","section":"Rants","summary":"A beautiful movie about depression","title":"Shape of Voice","type":"rants"},{"content":" Intro # This rant is about how to help yourself or others who are dealing with mental health issues, or more generally, how to be a better friend and a better person.\nEveryone needs to be a therapist # When someone shares that they are depressed or having suicidal thoughts, the first thing people usually say is \u0026ldquo;You need to get a therapist.\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s like telling someone who has been stabbed to call 911.\nYes, you should call 911 when someone is stabbed. Normal people aren\u0026rsquo;t trained to heal stab wounds.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s just as important that you do whatever you can to stop the bleeding as soon as possible. Although the ambulance is on its way, just like professional therapy, it will take a long time for the professionals to arrive and save the victim.\nIf everyone around the person who has been stabbed assumes that someone else will call 911 and apply first aid, the victim is much more likely to bleed out by the time the professionals arrive. If you want to make sure the victim will be okay, you have to go out of your way and get your hands dirty.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why everyone needs to be a therapist - so that you can stop the bleeding before professionals arrive.\nIt often takes a long time for someone to realize that they are depressed (as opposed to simply being unhappy or upset). By the time they realize it themselves, it\u0026rsquo;s probably pretty bad. And unlike an ambulance, therapy is a very slow process. In my experience, it takes weeks simply to describe your problems to your therapist and months before the therapy has significant effects on your mental health.\nWhat is therapy? # The second thing people tend to do when someone is depressed is to comfort them. \u0026ldquo;It will get better,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;We care about you,\u0026rdquo; and so on.\nThis is like telling the stab victim that they are going to be okay.\nThe problem is that this advice is usually very predictable.\nThe depressed person is not surprised when people tell them \u0026ldquo;we care about you\u0026rdquo; after they share\nTherapy is more about listening than it is about giving advice.\nDepression # What you have control over # What you don\u0026rsquo;t have control over # Self Harm # Defeating negative thoughts # Therapy # Professional Therapy # Therapy for a friend # Therapy for yourself # ","date":"23 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/unlisted/therapy/","section":"Unlisted","summary":"How to be a therapist for yourself and people you care about","title":"Therapy","type":"unlisted"},{"content":"This is stuff I want to share with people but only by link.\n","date":"23 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/unlisted/","section":"Unlisted","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is stuff I want to share with people but only by link.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Unlisted","type":"unlisted"},{"content":"Here\u0026rsquo;s my spoiler-free rant on why you need to watch the anime Attack on Titan.\nIntro # I have been lucky enough to experience a couple things that were so wonderful that they immediately changed my worldview.\nOne of those experiences was a sushi restaurant in Japan.\nWe had found a small sushi place that had four stars on google maps. The menu was just a $20 course and a $30 course with no descriptions, and I ordered the $30 course. The chef handed each piece of sushi over the counter as he finished making them.\nPrevious Nextsads I didn\u0026rsquo;t know it was possible for food to taste so good. Every bite was heaven. The flavor, the texture, the warmth \u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t have the vocabulary to describe how good it was.\nEver since, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel scammed whenever I eat out. Especially in the US. I still love good food, but nothing I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten has come close to that sushi.\nAttack on Titan changed how I see storytelling in the same way that sushi store changed how I see food. I absolutely love Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Ender\u0026rsquo;s Game, and Lord of the Rings, but Attack on Titan is on a different level.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll try to persuade you to watch Attack on Titan by shilling it\u0026rsquo;s music, art, characters, and plot, and finally I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how watching Attack on Titan made me a better person.\nMusic # I\u0026rsquo;ll start with this so that you can listen to the soundtrack while reading if you\u0026rsquo;ve got headphones.\nSoundtrack # Attack on Titan\u0026rsquo;s soundtrack is full of masterpieces.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a playlist of my favorites.\nOrchaestras with german vocals.\nThese songs hit especially hard once you watch the show and you feel the nostalgia pumping through your veins.\nIntros and Outros # Attack on Titan also commissions multiple unique intro and outro songs from famous Japanese bands for every season. These intros are paired with awesome animations that get you hyped for the episode. I like the diversity of music genres because it makes me appreciate styles of music that I ususally don\u0026rsquo;t listen to (Red Swan, The Rumbling, Name of Love, etc).\nArt # Manga # The Attack on Titan manga was written and illustrated all by one guy, Hajime Isayama. He started working on Attack on Titan when he was 19.\nThe following is one of the 33,000 hand-drawn manga panels.\nAttack on Titan is not a mass-produced TV show with the purpose of making as much money as possible. This is Isayama\u0026rsquo;s life\u0026rsquo;s work.\nAnimation # The best animation studios in the world, WIT and MAPPA, worked with Isayama to create an anime that takes the manga to a different level.\nHere are a few of my favorite nonspoiler shots. I love how they draw people\u0026rsquo;s eyes (see the gallery in the next section) and the clouds.\nPrevious Nextsads Imagine watching a TV show where this much skill and care is put into every scene.\nAction # They have this technology called ODM Gear which is like Titanfall 2 grapples on steroids. This, combined with epic titan-on-titan fights (choreographed with the help of professional martial artists), make Attack on Titan fight scenes super fun to watch.\nAot Levi GIFfrom Aot GIFs Characters # Attack on Titan shows you war through the eyes of soldiers, civilians, oppressors and the oppressed. But instead of \u0026ldquo;good guys\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;bad guys,\u0026rdquo; the characters are all written like real people that you can empathize with. As the story unfolds, you begin to understand the life and hopes and dreams of every character. The perspective of these incredibly well written characters helps you understand why people go to war and do terrible things.\nThe art and voice acting convey the emotions of the characters. Here are some shots of my favorite characters.\nPrevious Nextsads If you watch the first episode you\u0026rsquo;ll see the incredible voice acting I\u0026rsquo;m talking about.\nPlot # Premise # The premise of Attack on Titan is that all of humanity is confined inside big walls, and there are man-eating giants, called titans, outside of the walls. Humanity struggles to fight for their freedom and to learn about the world.\nI leave it at that because it\u0026rsquo;s better if you learn the rest by watching the first episode.\nWorld Building # Every detail of the world of Attack on Titan has been thought out and is eventually explained. As the story progresses, you and the characters learn more and more about how the world works and its deep history. With every season, you realize the world of Attack on Titan was so much deeper than you thought it was.\nPlot Twists # Attack on Titan plot twists will dislocate your jaw. The tension build-up and cliffhangers will make you unable to stop watching and the twists will change your understanding of the whole story.\nIsayama couldn\u0026rsquo;t have written the first chapter of Attack on Titan without knowing how the whole story ended. The foreshadowing is brilliant, and despite how unpredictable the twists are, they make so much sense in hindsight.\nEnding # There isn\u0026rsquo;t much I can say without spoiling, but the ending was truly incredible. I have never been more satisfied with how a story ended. All the characters and themes are tied together in a beautiful way.\nMessage # Attack on Titan is a serious story. There is little to no comic relief. While the action is at times exciting, it is full of death, blood, and pain. It\u0026rsquo;s impossible to tell a meaningful story about war without this.\nIf you are in the mood for something casual and fun, I recommend One Punch Man instead. It\u0026rsquo;s a hilarious anime about a desk worker becomes an absurdly powerful super hero and it has powerful themes about depression and what it really means to be a hero.\nBut watching a darker, more serious show like Attack on Titan is valuable because in addition to being enjoyable, it makes you understand and appreciate the world better. Watching Attack on Titan made me a better person. Here are the most important things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from this story.\nThe Meaning of Life # \u0026ldquo;The world is merciless and also very beautiful\u0026rdquo;\nIsayama shows the brutality of the world while also illustrating what makes humanity beautiful and worth protecting.\n\u0026ldquo;In that moment, the thought entered my head… that maybe the reason I had been born was so that the three of us could run this race.”\nAttack on Titan also depicts the value of the insignificant moments of peace and happiness that make life worth living.\nFreedom # \u0026ldquo;Fiery water! Lands of ice! Sandy snowfields! Let\u0026rsquo;s explore the outside world someday!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If someone is willing to take away my freedom, I won\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to take theirs.\u0026rdquo;\nAttack on Titan dives deep into the value and cost of freedom. What is freedom? Is it worth dying or killing for?\nWar # \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s us who give meaning to our comrades\u0026rsquo; lives! We die trusting the living who follow to find meaning in our lives! That is the sole method in which we can rebel against this cruel world!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I never thought that being sent to my death would turn out to be so utterly meaningless in the end.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you see them? Our comrades? They want to know what became of the hearts they gave up.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy do people give up their lives for what they believe in? Even when they know their individual deaths would have a marginal impact? Attack on Titan shows you what it means to die for a cause and grapples with the morality of war.\nCycle of Violence # \u0026ldquo;The world is a great, big forest where everyone\u0026rsquo;s fighting for their life. We gotta keep the younguns out of the forest. Otherwise\u0026hellip; nothin\u0026rsquo;s gonna stop it from happening again.\u0026rdquo;\nAttack on Titan depicts how revenge and greed lead to an endless cycle of violence. It shows how hard it is to escape this cycle and how we can move forward.\nIndoctrination # \u0026ldquo;You were children who knew nothing but it was drilled into you. You were just kids. What could you even do?\u0026rdquo;\nAttack on Titan shows you what indoctrination looks like and how it can make good people do terrible things. It illustrates how populations can be brainwashed and perpetuate ethnic hate.\nHow to watch # Streaming Site # I strongly recommend watching on Crunchyroll instead of sketchy sites like anime-update.com because the video, audio, and subtitle quality are much higher. Here\u0026rsquo;s the link to the first episode (you can watch the first season on Crunchyroll for free).\nWatch with friends # I recommend watching Attack on Titan with friends or family. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to talk about your favorite scenes, your favorite characters, the moral dilemmas, the plot twists, or the cliffhangers. There\u0026rsquo;s a special bond that comes from experiencing a masterpiece together.\nSub vs Dub # You should watch in Japanese with English subtitles because the Japanese voice actors are on a different level. You can really feel the difference even if you don\u0026rsquo;t speak Japanese. Trust me.\nConclusion # You need to watch Attack on Titan.

Additionally, the measured torsional stiffness (2000 +/- 80 Nm/deg) was more than double the measured torsional stiffness of our 2023 car, exceeding our design requirement of 1900 Nm/deg.

In just three months, I\u0026rsquo;ve been convinced that Mujin is one of the top 3 coolest robotics companies in the world. The internship was in Tokyo, Japan, but (almost) everyone in the company speaks English.\nI summarize my internship experience in this interview: Mujin\u0026rsquo;s robots automate warehouses and factories, allowing humans to do more meaningful work.\nMujin can automate a huge range of tasks, including unloading trucks, sorting automotive parts, picking gears, sorting groceries, sorting medicine, and much more.\nWhile most competitors rely on deep learning for path planning, Mujin uses mathematical algorithms built into the \u0026ldquo;Mujin Controller\u0026rdquo; that allow the company to branch out to so many applications while maintaining extremely high reliability.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a video showing off a small sample of Mujin\u0026rsquo;s capabilities:\nI primarily worked on the manipulator of the first robot shown - the \u0026ldquo;L-shaped gripper\u0026rdquo;.\nMy responsibility was making this gripper crash-proof. Although Mujin\u0026rsquo;s robots crash extremely rarely, it\u0026rsquo;s really bad when they do. The production lines they are used in can make thousands of dollars per minute, so downtime is super expensive. When you include costs of sending a repair team immediately and the replacement mechanism, it becomes clear that if my damper only has to work once in production to pay itself off (and my internship).\nUnfortunately I am not able to share technical details or photos of my project.\nI started by carefully watching the videos and reading the documentation of all the accidents that this gripper has been involved in. I used these to form design requirements for a damper that would prevent damage in almost all scenarios.\nI designed the damper, and after two design reviews I made drawings which were sent out within the first month of my internship. While waiting for the parts to arrive, I redesigned the rest of the gripper, removing an unnecessary mechanism and making parts lighter and more compact.\nI made assembly drawings and built the gripper with help from the manufacturing team. Once it was in good shape, I ran a series of increasingly aggressive tests to optimize adjustable parameters and verify that my mechanism met design requirements.\nThe damper passed the tests exactly as expected and is ready for production.\nBy the end of my internship, I had made a ridiculous number of drawings: In addition to the engineering, I really enjoyed the culture of Mujin. Whenever I had a question, my mentor would go out of their way to answer to the best of their ability. People on other teams were extremely supportive and helped me tremendously.\nPerhaps most importantly, we had great social events.\nIn addition to being a legendary programmer, the CTO, Rosen, is naturally a Starcraft 2 god. His viking + battleship army somehow annhilated my broodlords. We had monthly team dinners where we got to know each other better and enjoyed delicious Japanese food.

I strongly believe that the best way to have a good UROP experience is finding a good mentor.\nHis research is super cool (tldr he uses math to improve SLAM algorithms) and he was the captain of Illini Motorsports, the best internal combustion formula student team in the US.\nMore importantly, he\u0026rsquo;s an amazing person and mentor. When I began the UROP, he sent me a writeup of his undergrad research philosophy. I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to summarize the main points:\nBlog posts he sent that I strongly recommend (especially the first one)\nRose Wang’s Blog Post: Dear future undergraduate researcher Shashank Srikant’s Post: Aspiring Academics Will Chrichton’s Post: Making the most out of CMU It\u0026rsquo;s important to make a serious commitment on both sides. The undergrad should be independent and spend 12+ hours a week and the mentor should support the undergrad and help them make progress.\nPeer-based interaction is important even if the undergrad knows way less than their supervisor. If the undergrad\u0026rsquo;s ideas are always valued and respected, they can voice their opinions freely and there is a much more friendly and fun dynamic.\nThese are the characteristics you should look for in a UROP supervisor. Find someone who is committed to mentorship and values your ideas. You should also leave enough room in your schedule to make a contribution to the lab so you don\u0026rsquo;t waste your mentor\u0026rsquo;s time.\nProject # IMUs are critical for marine robotics because there is no GPS signal at the bottom of the ocean. Unfortunately, IMUs experience drift. The goal of my project is to reduce IMU drift by collecting IMU data using a 6-axis robot arm and training a machine learning model.\nThe Robot # The robot I used is called the UR3e. I named it Armin.\nThe first thing I had to do was bolt the robot down to a table, which required buying some really long bolts because of how the base is designed.\nTeach Pendant # The robot comes with a tablet called a \u0026ldquo;teach pendant\u0026rdquo; that you can control the robot manually with. It\u0026rsquo;s super easy to learn - just go to program and create waypoints (the easiest way to do this is with the freedrive option) and you can make the robot go back and forth between the points you set.\nI used the teach pendant to make the following video within half an hour of setting up the robot:\nUpdate Polyscope # First you have to update PolyScope (the pendant software) to 5.5.1. Here\u0026rsquo;s the universal robotics page on how to do that. Note the all caps and bolded text.\nURCap # Next you will want to install a URCap. A URCap is a block you can put in your teach pendant program that will allow you to control the robot through the ROS driver. To connect the robot to the PC, it\u0026rsquo;s easiest to use the ethernet port inside the control box. Here\u0026rsquo;s a guide on how to do that.\nCalibration # It\u0026rsquo;s very important to get the robot calibration information so that the forward kinematics are accurate. Here is a guide on how to do this. There is more calibration information in the main driver page.\nLinux # Ubuntu # You\u0026rsquo;ll want to install Ubuntu 18.04 on a laptop (preferably one with an ethernet port). It needs to be 18.04 because the Universal Robots ROS Driver is only stable for ROS Melodic, which requires Ubuntu 18.04. I tried ROS Noetic with Ubuntu 20.04 and it gave me problems so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend it. Switching to ROS Melodic and Ubuntu 18.04 made my life much easier. I also tried using WSL but that made connecting to the robot and IMU hard so I switched to one of the lab\u0026rsquo;s spare laptops.\nReal-time kernel # It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to install a real-time kernel, but it was giving me trouble and isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary so I skipped it. Here\u0026rsquo;s a guide on how to set up a real-time operating system.\nROS # Learning ROS # ROS is a publisher-subscriber-based framework for using a bunch of different packages together. I learned how to use it by following the official ROS Tutorials, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how much I can recommend this. Personally, the tutorials were quite dry and I think I could have learned what I needed to know on the fly much more easily.\nROS Install # First, install ROS Melodic according to this guide. Melodic is the only version that works with the universal robotics driver.\nIMU # I used the Vectornav VN-100 IMU. It\u0026rsquo;s an old model but pretty nice as far as IMUs go. Research grade IMUs are on the order of $1000.\nMechanical # I 3D printed an adapter to mount it to Armin.\nFor cable management, I used some velcro straps as shown below:\nROS Driver # I used dawonn\u0026rsquo;s Vectornav ROS driver. Once you install it, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to run the following line to allow the driver to access the USB port.\nsudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0 Then run\nroslaunch vectornav vectornav.launch to get the IMU data.\nOrientation # The data from the vectornav is in the IMU message format. Nicer IMUs integrate linear acceleration themselves and give you odometry messages as well, but the VN100 only gives you angular velocity and linear acceleration data.\nI installed imu_tools, a ROS package that applies some filters and fuses angular accelerations into an orientation.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll have to remap the IMU driver\u0026rsquo;s topic to imu/data_raw for the imu_tools package to work. Here\u0026rsquo;s a guide on how to do that.\nI used the following line (after running vectornav.launch) to get the orientation.\nrosrun imu_filter_madgwick imu_filter_node --ros-args -p _use_mag:=false Then\nrosrun rviz rviz allows you to visualize it. You\u0026rsquo;ll want to install rviz if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already. By the way, I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many times I was confused that rviz wasn\u0026rsquo;t working and the reason was that I had typed \u0026ldquo;rvis\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;rviz.\u0026rdquo; Visualize is not spelled \u0026ldquo;vizualize\u0026rdquo; so I feel like the Z was just thrown in by an edgy developer.\nOdometry # I used the imu_to_odom package to integrate linear accelerations. I had to install a bunch of obscure packages that ETH likes to use to get this to build.\nI used the following line to run this package.\nrosrun imu_to_odom imu_to_odom_node /uav/sensors/imu:=/imu/data Biases # IMU bias is the acceleration that the IMU sees when it is not moving. Since accelerations are integrated twice to get position, this noise adds up extremely quickly and can totally throw off odometry. To remove bias, I recorded two minutes of imu data when it was not moving and calculated the average bias.\nThe following line creates a rosbag with two minutes of IMU data.\nrosbag record --duration=120 --output-name=bias.bag /imu/data I did this with both the robot on and the robot off to see if there was a significant difference. Here\u0026rsquo;s the data with the robot off: and the robot on: I concluded that the difference in biases were marginal. MoveIt # MoveIt is the software that plans out the arm\u0026rsquo;s movements. This is way harder than it looks because 6-axis arms have joint positions called singularities where the robot would have to move at infinite speed to move a small distance in certain directions.

This will require making python scripts.\nMoveIt has an excellent tutorial on how to do this.\nYou can build all kinds of trajectories, but watch out for singularities as they will get in the way of seemingly simple trajectories. Unfortunately, despite having 6 axes, a robot arm cannot always move in a straight line while maintaining tool orientation.

I owe this entirely to Alan, who was an incredible mentor. I would not have made the time to write this blog post if not for how well he treated me.\nIf you are considering undergraduate research, make sure to take a lighter courseload, especially if you do time consuming extracurriculars like FSAE. In fact, if you are doing a student build team, I would recommend saving research for a summer internship (or IAP if you\u0026rsquo;re at MIT) because it was really hard for me to make a solid contribution to racecar and research at the same time.\nIf you take anything at all away from this blog post, read Rose Wang\u0026rsquo;s undergrad research advice and remember this:\nFind a good project by finding a good supervisor.\n","date":"5 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/mrg/","section":"Projects","summary":"Collecting IMU data with a 6-axis arm","title":"Marine Robotics Group","type":"projects"},{"content":"Masterpieces are often hard to appreciate.\nGiant Steps by John Coltrane is one example.

This gives the car more traction so it can drive faster. The tradeoff between drag and downforce is discussed in more detail here.\nInspiration # I always start the design process by researching how my team and how teams better than us built similar mechanisms. I always want to build something meaningfully better than my team\u0026rsquo;s previous designs.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how MIT Motorsports has designed front wing mounting previously: And here\u0026rsquo;s how the best teams in the world do it: Source: Green Team (University of Stuttgart)\nSource: Team Delft (TU Delft)\nNotice how Team Delft\u0026rsquo;s front wing below is mounted to their suspension. This allows the front wing to dynamically stay off the ground as shown in this video.\nDesign Reviews # I made the following slides for my design reviews, where I met with the captain, mech E lead, and aero lead to get feedback.\nDRDR (Design Requirements) CoDR DR1 DR2 Unfortunately there wasn\u0026rsquo;t time for a final DR before the front wing was manufactured, so the final design is different. The DRs above might be interesting to look at to see the design iterations, however.\nAfter DR2 I learned that the carbon fiber layups on our nosecone were done inaccurately, so the front wing mounting would need significantly more clearance than I had designed for. In hindsight, I should have checked with the aero team at the beginning to confirm the critical dimensions rather than blindly trusting CAD.\nDesign Requirements # If the front wing touches the ground during a race, we\u0026rsquo;ll be disqualified. The largest forces on the front wing will be while turning as tightly as possible as fast as possible. I conservatively decided to design for a worst-case scenario of making a 25 foot radius turn at 30 miles per hour.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also required by rules that the front wing mounting shears at 60 kilonewtons so that the impact attenuator can safely deccelerate the car if we crash. It\u0026rsquo;s easily calculated that four 10-32 bolts will shear at this force.\nDesign Choices # In previous years, we mounted the front wing using its vertical panels. But this requires the vertical panels to be structural. To save weight, we used light panels and added mounting holes to the front wing\u0026rsquo;s aluminum ribs.\nI also chose to use box tube and 3D printed inserts. In previous years, we machined dovetails that allowed the front wing to be taken on and off the car more easily. Dovetails are challenging to machine and only makes assembly marginally easier. Using box tube and 3D printed inserts with captured nuts still allows the front wing to be assembled without a wrench, but simplifies manufacturing significantly. Perhaps most importantly, the dovetail design would get caught on the nosecone as you tried to remove the front wing, making assembly difficult.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t want to have to set the car\u0026rsquo;s ride height before welding the tubes on the car, so I included additional holes in the box tubes so the front wing can be moved up or down after the tubes are welded.\nThin aluminum plates are very strong for in-plane forces, but they bend easily when out-of-plane forces or moments are applied. When the car is turning at high velocity, most of the drag is on the outer side of the wing, creating a z-axis moment in addition to the centripetal forces on the front wing. This puts a bending load on the thin plates.\nIncreasing the plate\u0026rsquo;s thickness or changing its material adds a lot of weight, so instead I added tensioned steel wire to prevent the plates from bending.\nHand Calcs # I validated my design by calculating when the bolts will shear due to in-plane forces and how much the plates will deflect due to out-of-plane forces. My calculations showed that 10-32 bolts, 0.04\u0026quot; diameter steel wire, and a 0.125\u0026quot; thick aluminum plate would be enough. I made very conservative simplifying assumptions such as treating the aluminum plate as just one beam conecting the upper mounting bolts, which allowed me to lighten the plate significantly with cutouts.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the link to my hand calcs.\nManufacturing # I used the 4-axis lasercutter in Morningside (the design makerspace above shop) to make the box tubes. Two of the tubes have cutouts to prevent intersection with one of the frame tubes. We 3D printed the captured-nut insert and welded the tabs using a jig to ensure that the mounting holes were perfectly aligned on both sides of the car. I lasercut the gooseneck because our waterjet was down. We had to make custom length spacers on the lathe because of a design change made after the front wing had begun manufacturing. The cantilever isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal but the diameter is large enough that the connection is still very stiff. Here is a photo of everything assembled except the safety wire.\nThe front wing comes off the car with just four bolts.\nResults # The front wing didn\u0026rsquo;t fall off during competition. But a different team\u0026rsquo;s front wing fell off when they hit a cone and they ran the wing over. Hitting a cone gives you a time penalty, but the front wing falling off is a DQ. So instead of designing for the cornering loads, I should have designed for cone collision loads.\nConclusion # I used mechanics principles to design a lightweight but strong front wing mounting solution that is easy to remove from the car. Here are some things I learned:\nChanging materials or increasing thickness is often an inefficient way to increase strength Take advantage of geometry (tensioned wire, I beams, etc) Check critical dimensions in real life (sometimes CAD isn\u0026rsquo;t accurate enough) Hand calcs help you understand what you\u0026rsquo;re designing ","date":"26 May 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/fwm/","section":"Projects","summary":"Learning to design efficiently using hand calcs","title":"Front Wing Mounting","type":"projects"},{"content":"Thursday night I went to shop at 7 pm for a MIT Motorsports all hands meeting.

I\u0026rsquo;ll show my appreciation for the people who gave me excellent advice by trying to pay it forward \u0026mdash; the following is an essay about my own advice for high school students. But first, please read Paul Graham\u0026rsquo;s essay about high school. It\u0026rsquo;s really good and you won\u0026rsquo;t regret it.\nMotivation is the bottleneck # When I was in high school, my excuse for a lot of things was \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t have time\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t have the resources\u0026rdquo;. I told myself that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t my fault.\nI was wrong. I had plenty of time and resources. What I didn\u0026rsquo;t have was motivation. If I really wanted to learn how to solve differential equations or build a CNC machine, I totally could have. At MIT I\u0026rsquo;ve met people who built walking quadrupeds, nuclear fusors, and synchronous reluctance motors in high school. These people aren\u0026rsquo;t any more special or priviledged than you or me. They love what they do and worked really hard, every day, until they became really good at it.\nBut how do you find motivation to work hard?\nYou might think you need to have really strong discipline. But I have terrible discipline. I procrastinate and get distracted whenever I have to do boring work, even when it\u0026rsquo;s really important (homework, getting a driver\u0026rsquo;s license, etc).\nThe way to work hard without needing strong discipline is to work on fun projects. Spend time on projects that are both challenging and exciting. Then the motivation will come naturally. You\u0026rsquo;ll want to work on your project as much as possible.\nWhat if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you\u0026rsquo;re passionate about?\nI\u0026rsquo;ll use my own experience as an example.\nI fell in love with robotics for three reasons \u0026mdash; excitement, competitiveness, and friendship. I\u0026rsquo;ve always thought robots were really cool, so I joined my middle school\u0026rsquo;s FIRST Lego League team. We got obliterated at every competition (back in my day you could get negative points). I was so mad. My desire to win made me work really hard to get better at building robots, and almost by accident I made really good friends while building these robots. There\u0026rsquo;s a certain comaraderie forged from building robots late into the night that you can\u0026rsquo;t get from just playing video games together (some people refer to this as trauma bonding).\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you are passionate about, join a club that does cool things. The cool factor and the friends you make will motivate you to work hard.\nYour time is precious # Sitting in a classroom all day might make you feel like your time isn\u0026rsquo;t worth much. But your time is way more valuable than that. There\u0026rsquo;s so many awesome things you can do.\nThe internet is full of world-class educational resources if you just know where to look. The point of this pile of links is to show that the quality of your high school is not limiting you.\nMIT OpenCourseWare # These free online courses are really good. Actually, I often skip in-person lectures so that I can watch OCW videos. They record lectures of the most popular professors so they are much better than the average in-person lecture at MIT. Here are some introductory classes I\u0026rsquo;ve taken that have really good OCW counterparts:\n3.091 (Solid State Chemistry) 18.01 (Single-variable Calculus) 18.02 (Multi-variable Calculus) 18.03 (Differential Equations) 8.01 (Classical Mechanics) 8.02 (Electricity and Magnetism) 2.001 (Mechanics \u0026amp; Materials I) Stanford Machine Learning class # videos, course notes, coding assignments. I haven\u0026rsquo;t taken this course, but someone I know said it was really good.\nHarvard philosophy class # You may not care for philosophy, but Michael Sandel is a rockstar. His philosophy lectures fill concert stadiums worldwide. Watch the first lecture and you\u0026rsquo;ll see why. Or read his book.\nHistory Books # The best way to learn history is not studying a Princeton Review AP US History prep book. You should read good history books. There are so many, but I\u0026rsquo;ve only read a couple. Guns, Germs, and Steel is an incredible nonfiction book taking a scientific approach to history and The Grapes of Wrath illustrated human suffering and spirit so well that it made me cry.\nProgramming Courses # There are more high quality resources for learning programming than there are for any other subject. Personally I can recommend this python course. But once you\u0026rsquo;ve learned the basics of programming, I highly recommend you try working on a project of your own (courses don\u0026rsquo;t mean much if you don\u0026rsquo;t apply your skills).\nProgramming Challenges # Project Euler has really fun and challenging programming challenges that I recommend. For learning controls (how to program robots), check out these awesome programming challenges.\nMath Textbooks # A lot of people think they are \u0026ldquo;bad at math\u0026rdquo;. This is because most math teachers are terrible (this beautiful essay explains why). The internet comes to the rescue once again. The Art of Problem Solving sells extraordinary math textbooks. They also have a free online learning system called Alcumulus. AoPS teaches you how to learn math by solving challenging problems and proving theorems, not just memorizing formulas and step-by-step solutions. Having completed almost all of the AoPS textbooks, I cannot recommend them enough. They are hard, but they will fundamentally change the way you think about math.\nRobotics # If your high school has a robotics team and you like robots, you should join. You can also start your own team. The advantage of starting your own team is that you decide the team culture. In my experience, team culture is the biggest contributor to success in robotics competitions. As I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned before, building robots is way more fun when you do it with friends, and the competition is a strong motivator.\nCAD # For learning how to design robots (or other things) with Computer-Aided Design (CAD), I strongly recommend Onshape. It\u0026rsquo;s really intuitive and has excellent online tutorials. Onshape is completely free for students. If you school or robotics team gives you access to SolidWorks, that\u0026rsquo;s good too. Avoid Fusion360, it\u0026rsquo;s terrible CAD software (good for CAM though).\n3D Printing # You can build almost anything with just a 3D printer. If you have the money, I highly recommend Prusa machines, because the reliability and print quality is unmatched. Cheap 3D printers are tempting, but be warned that they require a ton of maintenance and upgrades (I learned this the hard way). If you want a challenge, try building a high performance 3D printer. I recommend RatRig and Voron. It\u0026rsquo;s intimidating, but there are entire discord communities and youtube channels on your side.\nMachining # Making metal parts is really cool. For a couple grand you can buy a CNC router, which is very valuable for high performance robots. I recommend the Omio line of CNC machines. Fusion360 is a great free Computer-Aided Machining (CAM) software with tons of online resources that makes it easy to learn.\nPersonal Projects # If you want to be good at anything, you need to work on projects of your own. I have a friend who taught herself how to code and is now making 6 figures at an AI startup straight out of high school. She just really loves programming. Ben Katz, the creator of the MIT Minicheetah, became an incredible engineer by building things for fun (read about his projects on his blog). You\u0026rsquo;d be surprised by how much you can do by yourself.\nCollege Applications # I feel obligated to include this because many high school students think a lot about college applications.\nHow do you get into your dream school?\nDo what you love and don\u0026rsquo;t waste time. MIT Admissions officer Chris Peterson wrote an excellent essay on this topic.\nDo what you love because it\u0026rsquo;s exciting. If you think robots are cool, build robots. If you think video games are cool, program some video games. This is worth doing whether you get into your dream school or not.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t waste time. To quote Paul Graham\u0026rsquo;s essay Life is Short,\nRelentlessly prune bullshit, don\u0026rsquo;t wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have.\nConclusion # As a high schooler I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how much I could do if only I tried hard enough. I hope that this post helps you appreciate how valuable your time really is.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll end this post with a quote from the Paul Graham essay that I recommended in the beginning.\nMaybe you can be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn\u0026rsquo;t how much time you wasted.\n","date":"25 March 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/rants/highschool/","section":"Rants","summary":"Things that I wish I had known","title":"High School","type":"rants"},{"content":"I machined four coldplates for MIT Motorsports. Coldplates are aluminum parts that have channels for cold water to pass through. The coldplates I made were for the battery. We make them in multiple parts and have them brazed so that they are watertight.\nDip Brazing is a process where you cover a joint with a molten filler metal and let it harden to form a watertight bond between them. The last time we tried making cold plates, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t be brazed properly because we used 7075 aluminum alloy, which has too low of a melting point to be brazed effectively. This time we are using 6061 aluminum.\nFirst we faced the stock so that it would be flat on the bottom. We used a vacuum plate for this but decided against using it for the actual machining because it was getting shifted.\nThen we applied tape to the faced side of the stock as well as a larger piece of stock (which was also faced) and superglued the tape together.\nNext we clamped the larger stock to the Haas with toe clamps and used a dial indicator to make sure the stock was straight.\nWe probed the stock to find its center. We found the bottom height of the stock by probing off of two layers of tape. The two layers of tape matches the height of the base of the stock we are machining.\nOnce everything was set up, we ran the gcode. At first, we got really big burrs. The endmill was dull, so it was pushing the metal up instead of cutting it. So we replaced the endmill and ran the program again.\nThe entire operation was an hour and a half of runtime so we only recorded the coolest parts. In this video it drills the holes super quickly. We removed the plate from the larger stock using a chisel and hammer. The tape can be peeled off easily, leaving nothing behind on the part. We tapped the holes using a spring-loaded tool in the manual mill which keeps the tap straight and applies downward pressure. The parts came out pretty nicely. We made four coldplates in total.\nThe water will come in through connectors that are threaded into these cylindrical parts that will be brazed to the coldplate. This is what they looked like after being brazed. The inside of the battery looks like this. Water is cooled by radiators and pumped through the tubes which lead to channels inside the coldplates underneath the battery modules.

We put magnets inside every piece so that it can detect their positions using reed switches underneath the board. It moves the pieces using an electromagnet that can move to anywhere under the board. It decides what move to play using an open source chess engine called Stockfish. It\u0026rsquo;s almost unbeatable.\nWe showed off the robot at the MIT xFair. I managed to win a game against it with pure skill.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a professionally produced video by Project Manus (one of our sponsors): Mechanical # You can view our CAD here.\nMags is kind of like a 3D printer. Instead of a hotend, we have an electromagnet. We designed the CoreXY gantry to be as thin as possible. When assembling the frame and gantry, we had to make everything perfectly square and parallel, or the linear rails would not slide smoothly. I described this process here.\nThe motors are fast!\nWe got our final parts printed for us by Formlabs on the Fuse 1. SLS Nylon is precise and stiff, which allowed us to make our gantry stiffer and straighter.\nWe waterjet the carbon fiber board: The carbon fiber slightly delaminated around the holes unfortunately.\nElectrical # Our sensor array is wired like a keyboard. We used reed switches to detect the magnetic fields of the chess pieces. We use an input matrix to sample all 64 squares with just 16 pins. We wired it up by hand because we didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to design a PCB. In hindsight we really should have designed a PCB.\nAbove is the wiring diagram for the board. It\u0026rsquo;s exactly how high performance keyboards are wired. We set one column to high and see which rows get power, revealing the reed switches that are triggered in that column. Repeating this for all 8 columns gives us the positions of all of the pieces. Having diodes on each reed switch gives us n-key rollover.\nThe electromagnet is controlled with a power transistor and a flyback diode. The stepper motors are controlled by TMC2209 drivers, which are controlled by a RasPi Pico running a 3D printer firmware called Klipper. The reed switches are wired directly to the RasPi 4B, which handles the high level code.\nCode # You can look at our code here. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly written in python. We used the A* algorithm to find the shortest path to remove captured pieces from the board without collisions, as shown in the screenshot above. The RasPi was too slow, so we ended up doing all the compute on a laptop which updates the display and sends g-code to Klipper via websockets.\nMoney # We got $500 of funding from ProjX and $850 of funding from the MIT IAP Minigrant. Here\u0026rsquo;s our budget spreadsheet.\nConclusion # This project was really fun. I learned a lot of things, but most importantly I learned:\nAssembly is hard (if anything isn\u0026rsquo;t assembled properly, the linear rails will bind) Motivation is the bottleneck (most of our work was done as close as possible to the career fair demo) Do what needs to be done first. Making this project work required focusing on the most urgent things, from manual labor to code. Areas for improvement:\nReed switches suck. They have blindspots and are unreliable. We should have a 400x400mm PCB that has a ton of SMD hall-effect sensors on it instead. We spent too much money. We could\u0026rsquo;ve built Mags for $500 if we needed to, but having such a large budget made us spend money on things we probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have. People have told me we should make Mags have an easier difficulty. But I\u0026rsquo;d rather make Mags a robot hustler. When you make a blunder, Mags should roast you. When it wins, Mags should arrange the pieces to form a big L on the board.

The frame needs to be square, which is not easy because it\u0026rsquo;s huge. The linear rails need to be parallel or the the gantry will bind up. The x-axis rail needs to be perpendicular to the y-axis linear rails as well.\nManufacturing # First we 3D printed the parts. I reprinted them at least 4 times due to small design flaws (overoptimistic clearances, holes that were the wrong size, etc).\nOops.\nWe ordered the extrusion from Misumi. They face both ends of the extrusion to length such that opposite sides are exactly the same length. This is really important for making the frame square. They also machine tap the ends of the extrusion which is nice.\nWe made blind joints with M8 button head bolts. This is the easiest way to make a perpendicular joint.\nFirst we drilled access holes in the extrusion with a simple jig: The blind joint looks like this:\nFrame # The frame needs to be square if we want the gantry to be smooth. We don\u0026rsquo;t want a parallelogram. We also need the extrusion to be flat. We assembled the frame on the MIT Motorsports welding table because it\u0026rsquo;s really flat.\nJoint Assembly # Tighten the bolt enough that it resists movement Adjust the extrusion with a machinist square until it\u0026rsquo;s perpendicular Tighten the bolt completely while holding down the frame Step 2 is tricky because it\u0026rsquo;s easy to overshoot. You can tell if it\u0026rsquo;s square by feeling the edge between the extrusions with your finger. Step 3 is hard because tightening the bolt will make the extrusion want to rotate (with a lot of mechanical advantage). If the extrusion is even slightly angled, the gantry will rack because of how far apart the linear rails are.\nGantry # The square frame only guarantees that the linear rails will be parallel in one axis. When we assemble the rails we need to make sure that the the other axes are aligned.\nY-Axis Assembly # Use aligners to straighten one rail and tighten it completely Tighten second rail loosely while using aligners to straighten it Assemble the x-axis to both rails Move the x-axis back and forth to straighten the loose rail Finish tightening the second rail once the rails move smoothly These are the aligners we used to straighten the linear rails. We borrowed the CAD from the RatRig. X-Axis Assembly # Assemble x-axis Weave belt runs through pulleys and attach them at the tensioners Tension one belt Move carriage to the center bottom and tension the other belt until the x-axis is perpendicular to the y-axis The Zyltech linear rails we bought slide quite nicely (especially for only $20). We were careful not to let the carriage reach the edge so the balls don\u0026rsquo;t fall out.\nWe tension the belts by tightening a bolt which pulls a captured nut attached to the belt. Our belt tensioning procedure straightens the x-axis which makes the gantry smoother. Action # We wired up the electronics to get the motors running.

So as a Christmas gift, I made him a gerrymandering puzzle. I lasercut the parts out of acrylic with help from Gloria, and Claudius helped me glue the box together.\nThe Puzzle # Each piece is a county of Ohio. The puzzle is a lot harder than it looks. There are four complete sets of pieces in different colors. The base is inscribed with lines so that the puzzle isn\u0026rsquo;t pure hell.\nWe used an svg of the Ohio counties from Wikipedia to lasercut the pieces. We made the base by lasercutting two acrylic plates and gluing them together. The super glue dried in literally half a second. This made the two plates being slightly misaligned. Even worse, the superglue left a nasty smear in between the plates.\nLessons learned:\nEngraving is slow (the base took 1.5 hours) Use opaque acrylic with superglue Superglue dries super quick between large flat surfaces. Align carefully. The Box # I first tried making the box out of scrap plywood. It was ugly and the pieces didn\u0026rsquo;t fit. I made a new box using acrylic. It\u0026rsquo;s bigger and the corners are differently colored to match the pieces. \u0026ldquo;redist\u0026rdquo; is engraved on the lid. We superglued opposite corners first to make the box as square as we could because the tolerances were pretty loose. I\u0026rsquo;m really happy with how it came out.\nThe Game # There are a few ways you can play:\nVS: Each player gets a color. Everyone tries to play as many pieces as they can. The person who placed the most pieces when the puzzle is complete wins. The three of us got demolished by Claudius (green).\nCoop: The Four Color Theorem says that any map can be colored with only four colors such that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Fill out the puzzle so that no two adjacent pieces have the same color.\nThis took my dad, my sister, and I over an hour. To satisfy the four color rule we had to redo entire sections of the map. The best strategy is to figure out which piece you need and then look for it. If you choose a piece and then try to find its spot it\u0026rsquo;ll take forever.\nConclusion # Making custom puzzles is pretty easy and fun. I like making my own presents. There\u0026rsquo;s something special about seeing something I made giving joy to others.\n","date":"3 January 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/redist/","section":"Posts","summary":"A redistricting puzzle game","title":"Redist","type":"posts"},{"content":"Every year, MIT students run a really cool event called Splash. In one weekend, 2000 high schoolers come to MIT, where they choose from 500 classes taught by 400 college students in the area. Some classes from this year were:\n\u0026ldquo;Opening locks and doors\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How to fail AP Computer Science\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Introduction to Minecraft Speedrunning\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;So you want to be an astronaut\u0026rdquo; Check out the whole class catalog here.\nClaudius, Gloria, and I taught a class called \u0026ldquo;How to Design and 3D Print (almost) Anything\u0026rdquo;.\nPlanning # We wanted to teach CAD and 3D printing as well as possible in just 3 hours. We kept the class size small (10) so that we could make sure everyone had a great experience. Onshape was an easy choice for CAD software because it\u0026rsquo;s easy to set up and learn.\nWe wanted to manufacture something that our students designed. At first our plan was to 3D print their designs, but that would take too much time so instead we 3D printed coasters in advance and lasercut the students designs during the class.\nThe 3D printed coasters are easy to CAD and we used gyroid infill to make it look really cool.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s our lesson plan and our slides.\nThe slides cover manufacturing methods and how to design for 3D printing. Check them out! We have super satisfying manufacturing montages.\nTeaching # Teaching CAD is all about hands-on experience. So we spent as little time lecturing as possible so that our students were CADing for most of the class. We gave them CAD challenges of increasing difficulty and helped them when they got stuck and answered their questions. Our high teacher to student ratio (1:2) allowed us to have a lot of one-on-one time. Although we had 10 sign ups, only 6 students showed up. But if all 10 had showed up, we probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have finished in time, so maybe we got lucky.\nThe most challenging CAD challenge was the pencil, but all of our students were able to figure it out eventually. It\u0026rsquo;s tricky because you need to sketch in multiple planes, use both extrude and revolve, and subtract material. Everyone was also able to CAD the toaster and a custom design on the centerpiece. Gloria went to lasercut the centerpieces, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t finish lasercutting until 5 min before Splash ended. So I biked over to N51 and grabbed the parts, then biked back as fast as I could and delivered the parts at 5:59.\nThe picture didn\u0026rsquo;t come out well because the engraved patterns on the opaque acrylic are subtle. They looked good in person though.\nConclusion # Our class was awesome. Our students loved it and learned a lot. Planning could have been better but in the end everyone got their parts and we covered all the material. We even ranked 5th among all classes despite having only 6 students!

Here\u0026rsquo;s the Onshape link.\nDesign Objectives # I\u0026rsquo;ll begin with our overarching objectives.\nI want to build something better than what already exists. Some issues with existing robotic chess boards are:\nPiece detection: Magnetic piece detection is invisible and more reliable than touch sensors used by some boards Compactness: Robotic chessboards I\u0026rsquo;ve seen are at least 80mm thick. Mags should be thin. Aesthetics: Most robotic chessboards look like a normal chess set. But I want Mags should look more modern. Speed: I like things that move fast. Mags should be quick. Personality: Playing chess against a robot should be fun. Mags could offer takebacks and advice in easy mode, and roast you in hustler mode. Next I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about the design choices that address these issues.\nExterior # Mags looks very different from other robotic boards:\nFlipped motors: Reduces thickness to 40 mm and gives us space for bigger motors. Touchscreen: Gives Mags personality. You can request takebacks and Mags can tell you how bad your moves are. Carbon fiber board: Way cooler (and stiffer) than wood veneer. The squares will be on a vinyl sheet, which helps keep the playing surface flat. 3030 Extrusion frame: Easy to iterate quickly with. By tapping the ends, we can (relatively) easily make a stiff and square frame. 2020 extrusion is too small. We tried. Gantry # Mags is basically a simplified 3D printer. Instead of a hotend, it has an electromagnet. So we modified the gantry design of high performance 3D printers (RatRig, Voron, VZ-Bot) to fit in a 30mm tall frame.\nHere are the notable design choices:\nMGN12C Linear Rails: Compact, stiff, and smooth. 27mm tall is the perfect height for 3030 extrusion. Expensive but worth it. CoreXY: Moving parts are lightweight. Two tensioners on the carriage can straighten the X-axis. 3D printed parts: Fast iteration. Enables compact and complicated parts. Raspi Pico: Controls motors using Klipper (which doesn\u0026rsquo;t work on Teensies). Klipper is awesome. Closeups # In this section I\u0026rsquo;ll write about the more subtle design choices.\nPulley Block # The pulley block connects the x-axis to the y-axis and houses two pulleys. The assembly is split into three 3D-printed parts, the pulley block (isolated in the image below), the rail mount (the long piece that bolts to the x-rail), and the lid (the flat part on top).\nThe rail mount is a separate part so that we can print it flat on the bed for strength and dimensional accuracy. The lid allows us to assemble the top pulley without cantilevering it. The parts are precisely located to eachother with press-fit dowel pins. This is important because we want the rails to be as perpendicular as possible.\nThis is the right pulley block. Look familiar? The parts on both sides are identical. I CADed both sides separately before realizing this.\nCarriage # The carriage has two belt tensioners, an electromagnet, and a limit switch. We found a super cute limit switch called the \u0026ldquo;DH Ultraminiature\u0026rdquo;. The belt tensioners needed some really funky geometry to fit in such a small space: This is going to be a pain to assemble.\nCorner Mount # The corner mount is simple. It extends below the 3030 so that we can line it up perfectly. In the corner we have little rubber feet to dampen vibrations.\nMotor Mount # The motor mount is also simple. There is a separate end stop part that holds the limit switch. The parts are mirrored on the other side and the timing pulley is flipped upside down.\nBoard # The board has three layers. On top we have a 2mm thick carbon fiber sheet. The white squares are vinyled on. We\u0026rsquo;ll waterjet the carbon fiber and get the vinyl printed for us.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve made the carbon fiber sheet transparent in this image, revealing a 1/32\u0026quot; delrin sheet with circular holes. This acts as a spacer for the SMD hall-effect components on the PCB.\nOn the bottom layer, we have more delrin spacers and four 0.8x100x400mm PCBs. These PCBs detect which squares have pieces on them. Each PCB contains sixteen hall-effect sensors and a multiplexor breakout board.\nSummary # We\u0026rsquo;ve now designed a cool chess robot, but actually building it will be hard. I\u0026rsquo;ll order parts by the beginning of IAP (MIT\u0026rsquo;s january term) so that we can hit the ground running with manufacturing and assembly.\n","date":"25 December 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/mags_design/","section":"Posts","summary":"How I designed a chess robot","title":"Mags Design Review","type":"posts"},{"content":" Step 1: CAD # The cake is for my roommate Claudius\u0026rsquo;s MIT Nano advising seminar, so we designed it to look like a solar cell.

I built this monstrosity out of store-bought electrical components and hand-cut acrylic. We competed in the lightweight division.\nV1 Robot (yikes) We didn\u0026rsquo;t just get clapped. We own-goaled. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk about it.\nIn 9th grade, we won US nationals and qualify for the world cup in Sydney, Australia. This time, my robot managed to score in the right goal.\nV2 Robot We flew to Sydney. And got demolished. But while we were getting our butts kicked, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but be inspired by our opponents. Here\u0026rsquo;s a photo of team LEGEND\u0026rsquo;s robots (representing Japan).\nLEGEND Notice the custom PCBs, CNCed carbon fiber, and low center of gravity. LEGEND was the only lightweight division team to have a kicker, dribbler, and omnidirectional camera (there\u0026rsquo;s an upside-down conical mirror that allows the robot to see the whole field).\nI decided to specialize in mechanical engineering. I applied to Maxon\u0026rsquo;s Young Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Program and they generously provided us with with DCX19 motors. These motors are insane. Our initial robot was simple, but we began designing our own PCBs and parts.\nV3 Robot I added a kicker in our next major design iteration. It\u0026rsquo;s a 10 Ohm solenoid hooked up to a 60V boost circuit which was just enough to reach the kicker power limit. We tried saving weight by replacing the steel solenoid casing with plastic, but apparently the steel is critical to the power of the solenoid\u0026rsquo;s magnetic field. To our dismay, the COVID pandemic cancelled RoboCup 2020. But we got a surprise boost of inspiration from team Transcendence from Singapore, who made an excellent website documenting their robot.\nV4 Robot V4 included an omnidirectional camera. I redesigned the omniwheels and 3D printed everything in carbon fiber nylon to save weight. I ended up spending a ton of time upgrading my CR10 3D printer (All-metal E3D V6 hotend, SKR1.4 board, TMC2209 drivers, dual lead screw, Zesty sidewinder remote direct drive, improved firmware).\nV5 Robot Next, I added a dribbler, like LEGEND\u0026rsquo;s robots at Sydney. The dribbler was spring-loaded and could maintain of control of the ball and absorb impacts. The hardest part was staying under the weight limit of 1100 grams.

In 2022, we represented the United States at the RoboCup2022 in Bangkok. Our poster won the Best Poster award.\nRule Changes # The important rule changes in the Open league are:\n2200g weight limit (lightweight is 1100g) 18cm diameter limit (lightweight is 22cm) Golf ball (lightweight is a larger, IR-emitting ball) Design Changes # Since I was the team\u0026rsquo;s mechanical engineer, the biggest changes to the mechanical design are:\nMoving from brushed motors with commmercial gearboxes to brushless pancake motors with a custom gearbox Exterior line sensor PCB Packaging everything inside 18cm diameter while maintaining low center of mass Adding a second dribbler in the back for potential ball-hiding strategies 4S 2600mAh lipo (previously 3S 1400mAh) CAD # I designed our robot in Onshape. You can view the CAD here.\nScoring # Like our lightweight robot, our open robot scores using a solenoid kicker and omnidirectional movement. Motors # Inspired by Major League teams (college-level), we used Maxon\u0026rsquo;s 30W EC45 Flat brushless motors. These motors are very powerful and have a small footprint. Maxon generously sponsored us through their Young Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Program. Due to limitations of our motor drivers, we could only use a fraction of their power. In hindsight, we should have bought Maxon\u0026rsquo;s 4-Q ESCON motor drivers instead of trying to design our own.\nOmniwheels # I redesigned the omniwheels to have a 4.5:1 gear reduction. Major league teams typically buy steel internal gears and machine them to fit their wheels, but these gears cost $60 each and I don\u0026rsquo;t have access to CNC machines. Additionally, steel gears are heavy and take up a lot of space.\nI designed custom aluminum gears which were manufactured via wire EDM instead. Sonic EDM generously manufactured our gears for free. These gears are very light (21 grams) and their custom gear profile makes the teeth stronger. We filed the motor shafts to a D shape so that we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need set screws to attach the gear.\nLine Detection # Robots that go outside of the white lines on the field are removed from play. In previous years, we have had a ring of line sensors to detect the line. In 2022, I made the line PCB go around the perimeter of the robot so that we would see the line as soon as possible. This allows our robots to reach outside of the line while keeping a part of our robot inside bounds.\nWe determine the orientation of the line by adding the vectors of the triggered line sensors that are furthest apart, and use vector projections to stay within bounds. For details, see our 2021 technical paper.\nDribblers # Our robot has two identical dribblers. For simplicity, I did not include spring suspension in this dribbler design. I experimented with molding silicone sealant for the rollers. Silicone sealant doesn\u0026rsquo;t adhere to soapy water, so I sandwiched the roller between soap-covered negatives. Rollers molded this way were extremely grippy, but extensive iteration and testing demonstrated that silicone sealant was not durable enough. I switched to silicone tube which was much stronger.\n3D Printing # Although I used my 3D printer for prototyping, most of the final parts were 3D printed on a Formlabs Fuse 1. Formlabs generously gave me access to their Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) 3D printers, which can make complicated, isotropic nylon parts. SLS 3D printers create parts by using lasers to selectively solidify powder one layer at a time. The layers of powder act as support. Formlabs\u0026rsquo;s slicer, Preform, automatically packed 3 robots worth of parts into a single print.\nAfter my print job finished, a \u0026ldquo;cake\u0026rdquo; of powder was produced. I excavated parts out of this cake and cleaned them using a specialized tumbler.

Although I designed countless mechanisms for CADathons and practice, I only had the opportunity to build a few of them.\nI was elected Chief Technical Officer for my junior year, while everything was remote due to the pandemic.

In addition to box tube construction, I introduced rivets to the team (we had only used bolts previously).\nThe gearboxes were designed entirely by new members. I taught them how to CAD over zoom and led small socially-distanced meetings to build the drivetrain.\nThis offseason project was so successful that we used chain-in-tube for the 2022 competition.\n2022 Climber # In 2022, I led the climbing mechanism team. I helped new members CAD components that were critical to the success of the robot. The robot climbs three monkey bars using two telescoping hooks and two pivoting hooks.\nPhoto of the climber gearbox before assembly A unique feature of our climb is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t swing at all. This is because our robot holds onto both bars until the center of gravity is under the higher bar. As illustrated below, we designed the arms to bring the center of gravity 4\u0026quot; past the bar, ensuring that the pivoting arms come off the previous bar naturally.\nDue to our climber\u0026rsquo;s stability, we never fell, even when our teammates drove into us while we were climbing.\nI documented this mechanism and others extensively in the LigerBots OpenAlliance Build Thread on chief delphi. I was delighted to hear from one of our teammates at a competition that their climber design was inspired by ours!\n","date":"1 June 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/frc/","section":"Projects","summary":"Building a 125 lb robot that can climb 8 feet from the ground","title":"FIRST Robotics","type":"projects"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
