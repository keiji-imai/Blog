I love building things. I made this blog to write about my past and ongoing projects. I'm currently a freshman at MIT and I think I will major in mechanical engineering with a concentration in robotics ([2A6](https://meche.mit.edu/education/undergraduate/course-2a/control-instrumentation-robotics)). I also love to play piano, saxophone, and chess.
