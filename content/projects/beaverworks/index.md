In the final week of MIT BeaverWorks Summer Insitute 2021, Nandini Bezwada, Michelle Wang, and I programmed drones to fly through colored hoops autonomously. Using OpenCV's solvePnP function, we determined the hoop's relative pose and navigate through even if it is angled.

This was our presentation video which won us the best final project award.
