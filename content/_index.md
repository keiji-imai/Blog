I made this blog to write about my past and ongoing projects. I'm currently a freshman at MIT probably majoring in mechanical engineering with a robotics concentration ([2A6](https://meche.mit.edu/education/undergraduate/course-2a/control-instrumentation-robotics)). I'm currently working on a [chess robot](https://kogappa.com/posts/chessbot/). My email is keijii@mit.edu.
