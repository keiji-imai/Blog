Hi, I'm Keiji. I'm a junior studying mechanical engineering at MIT. I spend a lot of time building racecars as a member of MIT Motorsports â€” last year I designed and built the frame and this year I'm leading the suspension team. I've interned at Mujin (industrial robotics automation startup in Japan) and SpaceX (the Starshield satellite program in Redmond, Washington). My dream is to start a hardware company that changes the world. Feel free to reach out to me at keijii@mit.edu.
