Masterpieces are often hard to appreciate.

[Giant Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwIC6B_dvW4) by John Coltrane is one example. If you don't understand the context of jazz and improvization, it's not clear why this particular song is considered a masterpiece. What makes it so much better than a less famous Coltrane song like [The Night has a Thousand Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPRCwpB1Ak)?

It's also not obvious why the Mona Lisa or Romeo and Juliet are so famous. You need to spend a lot of time studying music or art or literature in order to appreciate these masterpieces.

*Attack on Titan is an exception.*

After you've finished all 88 episodes, you will be in awe at how a mere mortal could craft such a beautiful story. The characters are so well written that you will feel their joy and sadness. When they die you will feel real emotions because the characters feel real. The plot twists will leave you in shock. The music will send nostalgia coursing through your veins. The art and animation will take your breath away. It's *so good*.

I'll try to explain the beauty of Attack on Titan by highlighting it's cinematography, characters, plot, and message. I won't spoil anything.

## Intro

The premise of Attack on Titan is that all of humanity is confined inside big walls, and there are man-eating giants, called titans, outside of the walls.

I leave it at that because it's better if you learn by watching it yourself.

## Cinematography

Attack on Titan makes the most of anime as a storytelling medium.

### Music

I'll start with this so that you can listen to the soundtrack while reading.

Attack on Titan's soundtrack goes hard.

Here's a playlist of my favorites.

The german vocals over the orchestra give me goosebumps every time.

These songs will hit even harder once you watch the incredible scenes they are used in.

### Art

The Attack on Titan manga was written and illustrated all by one person, Hajime Isayama. The following is one of the 33,000 hand-drawn manga panels.

Then the best animation studios in the world (WIT and MAPPA) work with Isayama to create an anime adaption that takes the art to a different level.

Here's a small sample of shots that I enjoyed.

## How to watch

I strongly recommend watching on an official site like Crunchyroll instead of a sketchy site like anime-update.com because the video, audio, and subtitles quality are much higher. Here's the [link](https://www.crunchyroll.com/watch/GR49GM4W6/to-you-2000-years-in-the-future--the-fall-of-zhiganshina-1) to the first episode (you can watch the first season on Crunchyroll for free with ads).
