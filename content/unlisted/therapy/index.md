## Intro

This rant is about how to help yourself or others who are dealing with mental health issues, or more generally, how to be a better friend and a better person. 

## Everyone needs to be a therapist

When someone shares that they are depressed or having suicidal thoughts, the first thing people usually say is "You need to get a therapist." 

That's like telling someone who has been stabbed to call 911.

Yes, you should call 911 when someone is stabbed. Normal people aren't trained to heal stab wounds.

But it's just as important that you do whatever you can to stop the bleeding as soon as possible. Although the ambulance is on its way, just like professional therapy, it will take a long time for the professionals to arrive and save the victim.

If everyone around the person who has been stabbed assumes that someone else will call 911 and apply first aid, the victim is much more likely to bleed out by the time the professionals arrive. If you want to make sure the victim will be okay, you have to go out of your way and get your hands dirty.

That's why everyone needs to be a therapist - so that you can stop the bleeding before professionals arrive.

It often takes a long time for someone to realize that they are depressed (as opposed to simply being unhappy or upset). By the time they realize it themselves, it's probably pretty bad. And unlike an ambulance, therapy is a very slow process. In my experience, it takes weeks simply to describe your problems to your therapist and months before the therapy has significant effects on your mental health.

## What is therapy?

The second thing people tend to do when someone is depressed is to comfort them. "It will get better," "We care about you," and so on.

This is like telling the stab victim that they are going to be okay. 

The problem is that this advice is usually very predictable. 

The depressed person is not surprised when people tell them "we care about you" after they share 



Therapy is more about listening than it is about giving advice.
