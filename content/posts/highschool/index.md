Since coming to MIT, I've learned a lot of things I wish I knew in high school. I'll try to summarize the most important things. But first, I strongly recommend you read [Paul Graham's essay](http://paulgraham.com/hs.html) about the same topic. It's really good. 

## Motivation is the bottleneck

When I was in high school, my excuse for not doing important things was "I don't have time" or "I'm not smart enough" or "I don't have the resources". I told myself that it wasn't my fault that I couldn't design a PCB or program in C++ or solve differential equations.

These were lies. I did have the time. I was smart enough. And I did have the resources. What I lacked was motivation. If I had *really* wanted to learn how to solve differential equations, I totally could have. [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) has completely free world-class online courses that I knew about, but never took advantage of. I know people who built [walking quadrupeds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sht5Nenk3Dg), [nuclear fusors](https://www.anhadsawhney.com/#/nuclear-fusor/), and functional jet engines in high school. These people aren't geniuses. They just love what they do and work really hard at it. It is insane how much you can do if you set your mind to it. So don't blame things outside of your control until you have done absolutely everything you can.

By motivation, I mean the willingness to work hard. Not working hard as in doing painful work (such as AP exams and tedious classwork). I mean doing challenging work. Not just challenging, but *exciting*. Building a [high-performance 3D printer](https://v-core.ratrig.com/) is really hard. But it's also super cool! My roommate Claudius built one, and I wish I had too. 

## Your time is precious

High school classes suck. Sitting in a classroom bored all day might make you feel like your time isn't worth a whole lot. But the truth is, your time is super valuable. There are so many incredible things you can do with your time.

The internet is full of world-class educational resources if you just know where to look. Hopefully this onslaught of completely free resources will drive home the point that motivation is the bottleneck.

[MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) These free online courses are really good. So good, in fact, that I often skip in-person lectures so that I can watch OCW videos. They record lectures of the most popular professors so they are much better than the average in-person lecture at MIT. 
Here are some introductory classes I've taken that have really good OCW counterparts:
 - [3.091 (Solid State Chemistry)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/3-091-introduction-to-solid-state-chemistry-fall-2018/)
 - [18.01 (Single-variable Calculus)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/video_galleries/video-lectures/)
 - [18.02 (Multi-variable Calculus)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/)
 - [18.03 (Differential Equations)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-03-differential-equations-spring-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/)
 - [8.01 (Classical Mechanics)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-01l-physics-i-classical-mechanics-fall-2005/)
 - [8.02 (Electricity and Magnetism)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2007/)
 - [2.001 (Mechanics & Materials I)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-001-mechanics-materials-i-fall-2006/pages/lecture-notes/)

Stanford Intro to Machine Learning class [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv), [course notes](https://cs231n.github.io/), [coding assignments](https://github.com/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/tree/master/assignments/2022). I haven't taken this course, but someone I know said it was really good. 

[Harvard philosophy class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdfcR-8hEY&list=PL30C13C91CFFEFEA6) You may not care for philosophy, but Michael Sandel is a rockstar. His philosophy lectures fill concert stadiums worldwide. Watch the first lecture and you'll see why. Or read his [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452731-justice?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=kPokpiprkP&rank=7).

The best way to learn history is not studying a Princeton Review AP US History prep book. You should read good history books. There are so many, but I've only read a couple. [Guns, Germs, and Steel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1842.Guns_Germs_and_Steel?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_10) is an incredible nonfiction book taking a scientific approach to history and [The Grapes of Wrath](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=c1DRKDZeBZ&rank=1) was so powerful that it made me cry.

There are more high quality resources for learning programming than there are for any other subject. Personally I can recommend [this python course](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/) and [this C++ course](https://www.learncpp.com/). 

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) has really fun and challenging programming challenges that I highly recommend. For learning controls (how to program robots), my roommate Claudius recommends these awesome [programming challenges](https://janismac.github.io/ControlChallenges/).

A lot of people think they are "bad at math". The truth is that their teachers were bad at math. The internet comes to the rescue once again. [The Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) sells books that make MIT math classes look bad. They also have a really cool free online learning system called [Alcumulus](https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus). AoPS teaches you how to learn math by solving challenging problems, not just memorizing formulas and step-by-step solutions. Having completed almost all of the AoPS textbooks, I cannot recommend them enough. They are hard, but they will fundamentally change the way you think about math.

Finally, if you want to be good at anything, you need to work on projects of your own. I have a friend who taught herself how to code and is now making 6 figures at an AI startup straight out of high school. She's not a genius, she just really loves programming. You'd be surprised by how far you can go with the help of the internet.

## College Applications

I feel obligated to include this because college is such a big part of many people's high school lives these days. Most of the people reading this are probably coming from my MIT Maker Portfolio.

How do you get into MIT (or the university of your dreams)?

Do what you love and don't waste time. MIT Admissions officer Chris Peterson wrote an [excellent essay](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/) making the same point.

Do what you love because it's exciting. If you think robots are cool, build robots. If you think programming is cool, write some cool code. This is worth doing whether it helps you get into MIT or not. 

Don't waste time because time is precious. You might not realize now, but [life is short](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html). So spend your time doing things you consider important.

## Conclusion

A lot of what I said might seem pretentious or obvious. But as a high schooler I didn't quite realize how much I could actually do if only I tried hard enough. I hope that this post helps open your eyes to how valuable your time really is.

Finally, if you haven't read Paul Graham's article I recommended in the beginning, here's [the link](http://paulgraham.com/hs.html) again. I'll end with a quote from his essay:

>Maybe you can be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't how much time you wasted.
