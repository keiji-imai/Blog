I made this blog to write about my projects. I'm a freshman at MIT studying mechanical engineering ([2A6](https://meche.mit.edu/education/undergraduate/course-2a/control-instrumentation-robotics)). I'm currently working on a [chess robot](https://kogappa.com/posts/chessbot/). Feel free to reach out to me at keijii@mit.edu.
