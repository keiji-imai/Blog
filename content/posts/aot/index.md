Attack on Titan is by far the best show I've seen. You should watch it too.


## Introduction
It's a story that begins with a simple premise. Humanity is trapped within massive walls, and outside the walls are hordes of enormous man-eating giants. As the main characters learn more about the world you will begin to realize how much more there is to this story. And unlike some other shows I can name (*cough Game of Thrones*), Attack on Titan gets significantly better with every season. By season four your mind will be blown more times than you can count. Unlike other anime, Attack on Titan has no fan service (stereotypical anime girls) and extremely well written female characters.


## Depth
Attack on Titan is not a light anime. It's a story about war.

Attack on Titan will put you in the shoes of people who:
 - see their friends and family killed in front of them
 - give up their lives for a cause
 - order soldiers to give up their lives
 - do terrible things
 - grapple with the weight of their actions and what they must do

By the end, everyone is a villain in one way or another.

Attack on Titan tackles heavy ideas such as:
 - Morality in war
 - Freedom
 - Oppression
 - Indoctrination
 - PTSD

The character development in Attack on Titan is next level. Even minor characters are given unique perspectives and backgrounds. By the end, you'll know the characters so well that you can truly emphasize with the extremely difficult choices they have to make.

## Cinematography

The cinematography of Attack on Titan is breathtaking. 

Hiroyuki Sawano's soundtracks are inspiring, haunting, triumphant, and epic. Here are some of my favorite pieces:

The art of Attack on Titan is just as beautiful. Here are some amazing shots that don't spoil anything:


## Conclusion

If you are interested in the morality of war, you HAVE to watch Attack on Titan.

The first season is on Netflix and the whole thing is on crunchyroll (it's worth every penny, trust me).
