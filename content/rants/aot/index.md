After watching the final episode of Attack on Titan, I felt compelled to write an homage.

## Intro

I have been lucky enough to experience a couple things that were so wonderful it changed how I view the world.

One of those experiences was a sushi restaurant in Japan.

While on vacation, my family and I were looking for a place to eat lunch and casually decided to eat at a random sushi restaurant which had 4 stars on google maps.

We sat at the bar in front of the chef and his assistant. The menu had two options, a $20 course and a $30 course. I chose the expensive one. The chef carefully made one piece of sushi at a time and handed it over the counter. He bragged about how good his sushi was as he worked so I didn't have high expectations.

I didn't know it was possible for food to taste so good. Every bite was heaven. If I could further emphasize how good this sushi was, I would. 

Ever since, I can't help but feel scammed whenever I eat out. Nothing I've ever eaten has come close to that sushi.

I was also inspired by the passion of the chef who devoted his entire life to sushi. He clearly didn't care about expanding his business or making money. He cared about making good sushi.

Attack on Titan was another one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences. As much as I love Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Ender's Game, and Lord of the Rings, Attack on Titan is on a different level.

Attack on Titan has deeply changed my understanding of war, human nature, and storytelling.

I'll try to persuade you to watch Attack on Titan by highlighting it's cinematography, characters, plot, and finally I'll explain how watching Attack on Titan made me a better person. I promise I won't spoil anything.

### Premise

The premise of Attack on Titan is that all of humanity is confined inside big walls, and there are man-eating giants, called titans, outside of the walls.

I leave it at that because it's better if you learn the rest by watching it yourself.

## Cinematography

The cinematography of Attack on Titan is as beautiful as it's story. As an anime, it's music, animation, and voice acting stand out from Western TV shows and movies.

### Music

I'll start with this so that you can listen to the soundtrack while reading.

Attack on Titan's soundtrack goes so hard.

Here's a playlist of my favorites.

They go above and beyond with a full orchestra and german vocals.

These songs will hit even harder once you watch the incredible scenes they are used in. Nostalgia shoots through my veins whenever I listen to Tooth-I or T-Kt.

Attack on Titan also commissions unique intro and outro songs from famous Japanese bands for every season. These intros are combined with awesome animations that will get you hyped for the episode. My favorite is Red Swan.

### Art

The Attack on Titan manga was written and illustrated all by one person, Hajime Isayama.

The following is one of the 33,000 hand-drawn manga panels.

Then the best animation studios in the world (WIT and MAPPA) worked with Isayama to create an anime that takes the manga to a different level.

Here are a few shots that I like. I love how they draw people's eyes (see the gallery in the next section) and the clouds.

The action scenes are also incredible, but you'll have to take my word for it for now because they contain spoilers.

## Characters

Attack on Titan shows you war through the eyes of civilians, commanders, soldiers, oppressors, the oppressed, the government, the corrupt, and more. But instead of showing you "good guys" and "bad guys," the characters feel like real, relatable people. As the story unfolds, you begin to understand the life and hopes and dreams of every character. Seeing the perspective of these incredibly well written characters makes you understand why people go to war and do terrible things. 

The art and voice acting really convey the emotions of the characters. Here are some shots of my favorite characters.

Watch the first episode and you'll see the incredible voice acting I'm talking about.

## Plot

The plot of Attack on Titan is god-tier. 

Each season is so much better than the one before it. The first season starts simple, but with every season the story gets much much deeper as the characters discover more things about the world. The plot twists are like nothing I have ever experienced (yes, even better than Game of Thrones). And the ending was even better than I imagined (unlike Game of Thrones :).

The foreshadowing and continuity is also incredible. Isayama couldn't have written the first chapter of Attack on Titan without knowing how the whole story ended. The entire story from start to finish is exactly how Isayama intended and it is beautiful.

## Message

> The world is merciless and also very beautiful

 -- Mikasa Ackerman

Isayama shows the brutality of humanity while also illustrating what makes humanity beautiful and worth protecting. There are countless more themes which I won't go into, but every one contributes to this overarching idea.

Attack on Titan is a serious story. There is little to no comic relief. While the action is at times exciting, it is full of death, blood, and pain. It's impossible to tell a meaningful story about war without this. If you are looking for something casual and fun, I recommend One Punch Man instead. 

But watching a serious show is valuable because in addition to being enjoyable, it helps you understand and appreciate the world better. Watching Attack on Titan has truly made me a better person. 

## How to watch

I strongly recommend watching on Crunchyroll instead of sketchy sites like anime-update.com because the video, audio, and subtitle quality are much higher. Here's the [link](https://www.crunchyroll.com/watch/GR49GM4W6/to-you-2000-years-in-the-future--the-fall-of-zhiganshina-1) to the first episode (you can watch the first season on Crunchyroll for free with ads).

I recommend watching Attack on Titan with friends or family. It's fun to talk about your favorite scenes, your favorite characters, the moral dilemmas, the plot twists, or the cliffhangers. There's a special bond that comes from experiencing a masterpiece together.

## Conclusion

You need to watch Attack on Titan.
