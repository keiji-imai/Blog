description: "3 reasons why I blog"
---

I had no plans of making a blog a few months ago. Here are the reasons that changed my mind.

## For Inspiration

Inspiration has two ingredients. First, you have to see something awesome. Then you have to convince yourself that you can do something just as awesome. 

I've experienced this first-hand. At RoboCup 2019, I was blown away by the insane robots we competed against. But after talking to the people who built them, I realized I could make world-class robots too. The same thing happened when I went to my first FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). I began to realize how much I could do if I set my mind to it.

You don't have to talk to your role models to be inspired by them. There are tons of fantastic resources on the internet. Some things that inspired me are:

 - [Paul Graham's essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) inspired me to pursue startups
 - [Team Transcendence's Website](https://bozo.infocommsociety.com/) inspired me to build better soccer robots
 - [FRC Reveal Videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=frc+reveal+video) made me fall in love with FRC
 - [Build-its](https://build-its-feed.blogspot.com/) and other [MITERS](http://miters.mit.edu/) blogs inspired me to make a blog

Paul Graham's essays actually inspired me more than Elon Musk's startups, because his essays made me believe that I could build an awesome startup. 

Having been inspired by so many people before me, it's my responsibility to help inspire the next generation of hackers. If I do something cool and write about it here, maybe someday someone will read this and be inspired to do something cool themselves.

## Recognition
I have selfish reasons for creating a blog too. I can use my website to showcase my projects for research and career opportunities. It's also useful to show off what I'm working on with friends. 

## Science and Technology

When I was building soccer robots, I spent days poring over blogs of past teams. For FRC, I spent a stupid amount of time reading  chiefdelphi (online forum) and studying CAD models of robots from previous years. My predecessors' documentation empowered me to build greater things.

I've always built stuff for fun. But if I don't write about my projects, I'm only helping myself. To contribute to science, I need to share what I learned. Documenting my work allows people working on similar projects to learn from what I did, making their projects even better.

## Conclusion

Now that I've explained why I made a blog, maybe I should start actually documenting stuff.
